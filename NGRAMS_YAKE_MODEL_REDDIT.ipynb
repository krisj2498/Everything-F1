       " '\\'english version\\nfor the first time, a formula 1 race weekend will take place in miami. the route in the sunshine state is therefore completely unknown - the drivers could only test it using the simulator.\\nthe fans are all the more excited about the performance of the individual camps and which updates can be expected. after the debacle in imola, special focus is on mercedes and lewis hamilton, for whom the new terrain in florida could also be an opportunity.\\nopponent red bull, on the other hand, is on top after the double victory in the autodromo enzo e dino ferrari. world champion max verstappen won ahead of teammate sergio perez and at the same time caused disillusionment at the scuderia, which could not live up to its expectations at the ferrari home game.\\nworld championship leader charles leclerc finished sixth, carlos sainz retired.\\nnevertheless, the outcome of the coming race weekend - not least because of the unfamiliar track - is completely open.\\nsaid street circuit, the miami international autodrome, which runs around the hard rock stadium of the miami dolphins, has many challenging corners and a 1.28 km long straight ready, in which top speeds of up to 320 km/h can be reached. three drs zones also provide a spectacle.\\nthe pay tv station broadcasts the race\\', \"i\\'m just glad mazepin is not racing this track.\\nfeel bad for latifi already tho.\"']"
