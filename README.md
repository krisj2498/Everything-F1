# Everything-F1

A social network analytics project on Formula 1 racing.
The use case consisted of a few teams (RedBull racing and Aston Martin) and F1 organisation with data scrapped from Twitter and Reddit social channels
Main motive was to track change user sentiment based on events across these 2 websites through wordclouds and n-grams on python
The insights gathered could be used by teams/F1 organization's marketing department to devise strategies as the questions of 'when?' and 'where?' are answered
