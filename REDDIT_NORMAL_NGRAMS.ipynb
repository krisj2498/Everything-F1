       "' \\'translated by deepl\\nthe fia is going to enforce more strictly the rule that drivers are not allowed to wear jewelry and wear their own non-fireproof clothing. indeed, it will become part of the technical inspection of the car.\\nit was before the australian grand prix that the driver notes, prepared by the race director, highlighted some already existing rules. drivers were not allowed to wear jewelry, nor were they allowed to wear their own clothing that was not homologated by the fia. lewis hamilton, among others, took umbrage and indicated that he would in fact be wearing more, while mercedes team principal toto wolff was surprised by the new race directors\\' focus points: \"is this the battle they want to take on hamilton now? well, if this is the worst, we\\'re not complaining.\"\\nteams now actually risk a penalty\\nthat mention of rules that have been in place for a long time had to be read as a warning at the time, as it now appears. now, in fact, the fia is going a step further. before the start of each weekend, the teams have to sign a document declaring that the car complies with the technical regulations. now, however, two additional passages have been included on that form. the teams have to declare that the drivers do not wear any jewelry and therefore do not wear their own clothing. racingnews365 has seen the document with these new passages.\\nthese two aspects are now part of the technical inspection of the cars, which means that if they are not met, the team\\'s registration must be considered \\'illegal\\'. normally, this will result in an exclusion from the race, but in practice it is possible that a fine or a grid penalty will be imposed.\\ntoto wolff already reacted to the shifting of the rules in the presence of racingnews365 and has now expressed a more nuanced opinion: \"we have to remember why the fia is doing this, namely to prevent injuries caused by jewelry. nobody is waiting for a freak accident in which that plays a part, so the fia has to draw a line somewhere. is this a key issue? i don\\'t think so, but i understand where it\\'s coming from.\"\\' \\'\"so, what\\'s the dress

coulthard: mick schumacher\\'s future depends on magnussen duel**\\n**if mick schumacher wants a future in formula 1, he must not look old against kevin magnussen - the dane is a surprise for david coulthard**\\nauthor: norman fischer\\nco-author: erwin jaeggi\\n05.05.2022, 17:25\\n**david coulthard: mick schumacher\\'s future depends on magnussen duel**\\nmick schumacher\\'s future in formula one depends heavily on how he fares against his haas team-mate kevin magnussen, says former driver david coulthard. schumacher was seen as a rising star after his convincing performances against nikita masepin in his first year, but has stagnated somewhat this season.\\nfor so far schumacher has been pretty much disenchanted by magnussen. the dane made his formula 1 comeback at short notice after a year out and has scored points in three out of four races so far. magnussen has already scored 15 points, while schumacher, along with nicholas latifi, is one of only two regular drivers without points.\\n\"mick\\'s future depends in many ways on the comparison with kevin,\" coulthard told the dutch edition of \\'motorsport.com\\' at an iwc schaffhausen charity event at miami beach golf club.\\n\"when you get into formula one you are given a rookie year, but then you have to deliver,\" the scot said. \"people don\\'t wait for you to be quick. you have to be.\"\\n**mick beats magnussen \"only with hard work\"**\\nso far, the german\\'s career has actually gone to plan: schumacher was champion in formula 3 and formula 2 and, according to coulthard, also had a \"very good first season in which he established himself.\"\\nthe unknown, however, was the comparison with team-mate nikita masepin. schumacher was clearly in control of the latter, though the haas was too slow to compete with other cars. but with the arrival of magnussen and the better performance of haas, there is now a comparison - and in that schumacher is currently still inferior.\\n\"in kevin he now has someone he can only beat with hard work,\" says coulthard, preferring to highlight the dane\\'s performance rather than belittle that of his predecessor masepin. \"the fact that he\\'s consistently getting the haas into the points shows that it was the right decision to bring him back.\"\\n**coulthard: magnussen drives \"liberated\"**\\nbut the fact that he currently has such a grip on schumacher also surprises the former vice world champion. he explains it in such a way that magnussen had actually already finished with formula 1 and is now getting another unexpected second chance in which he has nothing to lose.\\n\"it seems he is driving liberated,\" he says. \"in his first career with mclaren and haas, there was always some anger in his style.\"\\nnow, however, magnussen is simply driving consistently well and is 3-1 up against schumacher in both qualifying and race duels (go to overview). \"mick has had it quite easy against masepin so far, but now he has realised that he has a fast team-mate in kevin. and that has pushed mick. he has to step up now,\" said coulthard.\\n\"i think it\\'s a fascinating battle. it will be interesting to see how haas will

the fortunes of the world constructors\\' champion team. brackley\\'s team was sure they had a car with extreme aerodynamics that should have given them a one second advantage per lap.\\nthe facts have shown that this was not the case and, on the contrary, lewis hamilton and george russell found themselves as the third force with a silver arrow that pays a gap of six to seven tenths per lap from red bull and ferrari.\\nfor the mercedes technicians, the main difficulties derive from the exaggerated frequency of porpoising that brings the nefarious hopping almost all the way into the corners, while on the ferrari it runs out much earlier as the top speeds drop.\\nwhile we wait to see what mike elliott\\'s engineers have prepared for the fifth seasonal event (there\\'s a weight reduction of about 3 kg), we have to observe the front wing of the w13, which was designed for the miami straights almost 2 kilometers long.\\nthe image of giorgio piola taken in the paddock highlights how the adjustable flap has been redesigned to reduce drag: in particular, the incidence in the portion that goes from the nose to the support brackets has been reduced, while the trailing

given the margins of the midfield group that\\'s quite helpful.\\nfor context a tenth would have seen george move up one in bahrain. lewis into at least q2 and george up one again in saudi. no change in australia but lewis would have been a fraction behind norris. nothing would change in imola thanks to changing conditions and non-completed laps in red flags.\\nobviously this can be negated by

ramjiawan\\nthursday, 5 may 2022 07:57\\nmclaren boss zak brown says daniel ricciardo is not sure of a place with the woking-based team after 2023. the smiling australian had a volatile debut season at mclaren, but is also in 2022 slower than teammate lando norris.\\nricciardo was brought in for his experience in the top of the field. in his time at red bull racing, the australian was still able to pick up the occasional victory. when max verstappen joined in 2016, he was sometimes able to outpace even the 2021 world champion. nevertheless, the overall trend surrounding ricciardo\\'s arrival at mclaren is currently disappointing. the australian still has a contract until 2023 and therefore enough time to prove himself, but there are also alternatives for the team from woking.\\n**alternatives**\\nbrown states in conversation with formula1.com: \"we have one more season together after this year and of course we are already thinking about the long term.\" whether that will be with ricciardo or without the australian, brown does not say. **he does hint, however, that there are plenty of alternatives ready. \"we will test with pato \\\\o\\'ward\\\\ and colton \\\\herta\\\\,\" he says.** brown wants to postpone the decision on whether or not to extend the contract with ricciardo. \"it\\'s best not to commit to these things too early and we\\'re not in a hurry,\" he explains of the eight-time race winner\\'s tenure.\\n**ricciardo feeling better**\\napart from the contract, brown sees ricciardo doing better at mclaren this year. \"yes, he definitely is. his races are going better and he has won something in qualifying as well,\" the 50-year-old american says. the man who took carlos sainz\\'s spot at mclaren is also a year on. \"he\\'s not quite comfortable in the car yet, but his bond with lando is more than good. he has also got to know the team very well\", brown explains. after last season\\'s dip in form, brown is therefore pleased that ricciardo has found his way up the ladder. \"of course we are happy that he is back on top himself,\" he concludes.\\', \"why would they hurry? there\\'s plenty of time to negotiate indeed, since he\\'s signed until the end of the next season.\", \\'can you blame them?\\', \"if ricciardo continues to slump around in the lower midfield while lando challenges for podiums, i wouldn\\'t be at all surprised if mclaren buy out his contract and go with a new driver for 2023.\\nwhen it\\'s all said and done, i think ricciardo while be viewed as a capable driver that made some bad career decisions and survived off his red bull reputation for a bit too long.\", \"ive been around here for a few years and i\\'ve never seen such hate for danny, its like he killed everyone\\'s dogs. really not sure where its coming from tbh\", \"daniel is only 32...he\\'s got a lot left to give in formula one. i\\'m just amazed how far his performances have dipped. i guess he\\'s really sensitive to the car; if it\\'s not working to his liking, the results will be average/below average. what he had at red bull and to a degree at renault isn\\'t translating over at mclaren.\", \"i don\\'t know what people are talking about tbh. he was absolutely off the pace on bahrain but obviously recovering from covid and lack of track action.\\nin saudi he qualified next to norris and with only a tenth between them and his race pace was great before his retirement.\\nin australia he qualified a few places down on lando but finished the race only half a second behind him.\\nin imola, again only a few places down in qualifying on lando, finished directly behind i\\'m in the sprint, then his race was fucked in turn 1. partially his fault but bottas hit him anyway which damaged his car and ruined any fightback. but he kept going the rest of the race with a damaged car getting good data for the team.\\nhe\\'s a little short of norris atm, same as carlos is a little short of leclerc, perez a little short of max and hamilton a little short of russell. but it\\'s not like last year where he clearly could not get a handle on the car.\", \"its logical for mclaren to do that. sadly daniel since 2021 has big decline of form - losing to lando especially in qualies, adaptation problems in \\'21 (thanks to that mclaren was p4 not p3) and only had 2-3 flashes. for person who was in top 5 2020 drivers it is unacceptable.\", \"i don\\'t see ricciardo staying after 2023 if he keeps struggling that much compared to norris, but in f1 a lot can change in that timeframe. i sure hope he will improve his race pace.\", \\'oh ricciardo, i really hope you can prove the doubters wrong buddy.\\', \\'yeah, i listened to the podcast and this is clickbait. if danny performs well this year (and he has been on par with lando every race except the shunt at imola where he was right with lando), he will get another deal. but of course mclaren wants to see what their young drivers can do. every team feels that way.\\', \\'should hold on; then grab a senior porsche seat to help them get a grip early. feels like a good fit with his late braking and all.\\', \"unless something picks up with daniel i can see them getting o\\'ward or another one of the indy guys in\", \"good, he\\'s too much of a wildcard atm. needs to pull off a miracle in these next few races before we can even begin thinking of a future for ricc at mclaren. huge fan, love to see him in his prime again!\", \\'i feel like ricciardo is absolutely no certainty to retain his seat atm. his performance would need to lift substantially to justify an extension i would\\'ve thought\\', \\'i think danny was just really suited to red bull cars. he was known for breaking at the very last second and for his ballsy overtakes. i get the feeling that the mclaren is just a different type of car, and he is not suited to driving it. i bet if you could put him back in a rbr car he would be placing a lot better, but the fact that he has a huge salary and is getting beat by lando are already two strikes. zak mentions looking to the future, we all know that means putting an american driver in the second seat. unfortunately, you don\\'t look to the future with a guy his age in f1 anymore. it is a young man\\'s game now. i think he would just retire. he has said many times that if he can\\'t win a wdc then what\\'s the point. he has more than enough money, he will just land in la and have a bunch of sex.\\ni don\\'t really see him doing anything else in f1, frankly the guy is as dumb as a bag of hammers. but he looks good, so he will be just fine. i still don\\'t get the renault move he made, if not for the crazy money than what else would be the reason to go to a team whose engine just ruined your last shot at a wdc?\\', \"he is completely lost in that mclaren, for sure. but who could do better.\\ni don\\'t think there\\'s neither a better driver available nor an amazing rookie waiting for that seat.\\nmaybe they could reach an agreement with alpine and sign piastri (and maybe even use renault motors, that could be benefitial for both as the mercedes pu is quite weak and alpine could use the data analysis of two more cars), but i don\\'t know.\", \"smart from them, i\\'d go for someone else surely.\", \\'welp ..\\', \\'pato o\\'ward should get his seat!\\ntwo mexicans in f1 would be so amazingly cool.\\', \"i love danny ric as much as the next one, but his stay at mclaren has been underwhelming. racking up this kind of salary to perform at a mediocre level, most of the time below his teammate, doesn\\'t look great. maybe mclaren value his pr-power and technical insights more than we understand, but performance wise it\\'s hard to justify keeping him for the salary he has\", \\'deleted\\', \\'he doesn\\'t belong in f1 anymore\\', \"i would love to see him replaced by piastri.\\nif you win f3 / f2 back to back, you\\'re good, and deserve a shot. ric had his shot.\" \"now that i\\'m used to the 18 inch rims, these things look tiny lol\", \"i believe that\\'s actually the renault 2020 car, the rs20.\", \\'ot: i really liked slovenia when i went there\\', \"where did you see this? as a slovenian i feel it\\'s my duty to go see it in person.\", \\'where in slovenia excatly is this?\\', \\'holy bargeboards\\', \"the nose has alo\\'s 14, but towards the back of the car, you see

article\\nnyck de vries has not yet had any contact with the williams team about a possible switch to formula 1, he told gpfans. the driver from sneek is not aware of the rumours and emphasises that he will continue to focus on his formula e campaign.\\nearlier this week, there were rumours in the british media that the williams team would be interested in bringing nyck de vries in. the british team would like to continue without nicholas latifi in 2023 and is therefore looking for his replacement. according to sky sports, the team has its sights set on alpine reserve driver oscar piastri. however, joe saward, a renowned formula one journalist, said that williams doubts that this is the right move. the team would rather work on its own future by putting someone in that seat who is not linked to another team. de vries was put forward as the best candidate.\\n**de vries responds to rumours**\\nde vries himself, however, has no idea where this rumour came from. \"these rumours are new to me,\" the 27-year-old told gpfans in an exclusive interview. \"i have no idea where you read them \\\\the rumours, ed.\\\\ or where you came across them. but then i\\'m very curious where they got that from,\" the mercedes driver stressed. \"because honestly, i have no idea.\"\\nasked if de vries would consider a move to williams, he replied: \"of course, formula 1 is a dream. that is a dream for every young driver, but otherwise i think it is still quite early in the season. we are only at the sixth race in our championship. so yes, let\\'s first make sure we get a few points here

       " '\\'english versionfor the first time, a formula 1 race weekend will take place in miami. the route in the sunshine state is therefore completely unknown - the drivers could only test it using the simulator.the fans are all the more excited about the performance of the individual camps and which updates can be expected. after the debacle in imola, special focus is on mercedes and lewis hamilton, for whom the new terrain in florida could also be an opportunity.opponent red bull, on the other hand, is on top after the double victory in the autodromo enzo e dino ferrari. world champion max verstappen won ahead of teammate sergio perez and at the same time caused disillusionment at the scuderia, which could not live up to its expectations at the ferrari home game.world championship leader charles leclerc finished sixth, carlos sainz retired.nevertheless, the outcome of the coming race weekend - not least because of the unfamiliar track - is completely open.said street circuit, the miami international autodrome, which runs around the hard rock stadium of the miami dolphins, has many challenging corners and a 1.28 km long straight ready, in which top speeds of up to 320 km/h can be reached. three drs zones also provide a spectacle.the pay tv station broadcasts the race\\', \"i\\'m just glad mazepin is not racing this track.feel bad for latifi already tho.\"']"

       " '\\'translated by deeplthe fia is going to enforce more strictly the rule that drivers are not allowed to wear jewelry and wear their own non-fireproof clothing. indeed, it will become part of the technical inspection of the car.it was before the australian grand prix that the driver notes, prepared by the race director, highlighted some already existing rules. drivers were not allowed to wear jewelry, nor were they allowed to wear their own clothing that was not homologated by the fia. lewis hamilton, among others, took umbrage and indicated that he would in fact be wearing more, while mercedes team principal toto wolff was surprised by the new race directors\\' focus points: \"is this the battle they want to take on hamilton now? well, if this is the worst, we\\'re not complaining.\"teams now actually risk a penaltythat mention of rules that have been in place for a long time had to be read as a warning at the time, as it now appears. now, in fact, the fia is going a step further. before the start of each weekend, the teams have to sign a document declaring that the car complies with the technical regulations. now, however, two additional passages have been included on that form. the teams have to declare that the drivers do not wear any jewelry and therefore do not wear their own clothing. racingnews365 has seen the document with these new passages.these two aspects are now part of the technical inspection of the cars, which means that if they are not met, the team\\'s registration must be considered \\'illegal\\'. normally, this will result in an exclusion from the race, but in practice it is possible that a fine or a grid penalty will be imposed.toto wolff already reacted to the shifting of the rules in the presence of racingnews365 and has now expressed a more nuanced opinion: \"we have to remember why the fia is doing this, namely to prevent injuries caused by jewelry. nobody is waiting for a freak accident in which that plays a part, so the fia has to draw a line somewhere. is this a key issue? i don\\'t think so, but i understand where it\\'s coming from.\"\\'',\n",

i feel like i\\'ve heard relatively little about the team despite decent performances from bottas and zhou (just saw they are 4th in constructors)\\', \\'i\\'ve heard rumours about a ricciardo-gasly swap, does this rumour have any merit. or is it just something to gain attention?\\', \\'it is so annoying how hard they\\'re pushing the gp. sending george to a heat game, leclerc, checo and max to a marlins game, pierre meeting jordan and lewis with tom brady.\\', \\'no fernando at the miami opening??\\', \\'not sure why f1 is going with the \"so bad it\\'s good\" approach for this race, any idea?\\', \\'has there ever been an f! race where they just threw up a race track and no one really knew what was gonna happen on it like this?\\', \\'from my understanding, miami has a lot of long straights and red bull has been the fastest on the straights. therefore, max is the favorite this weekend. is this thinking correct?\\', \\'anyone order miami merch from mclaren? just curious if anyone has had their order ship yet? i ordered on launch day and only got an order email, nothing about shipping yet. was hoping to get it before the race sunday.\\', \"what\\'s the best site for buying gp tickets second hand? i\\'ll be in houston during the usgp on oct 23, i found some tickets on seatgeek, is that any good?\", \\'is miami open to general track/race activities beyond f1 like cota? or is this strictly an f1 venue?\\', \"when do you think the season\\'s first race without a safety car will be?\", \\'i feel like the drs will be overpowered here, the one in the finish straigh line looks fine, but the other 2 seems to long.\\', \\'can someone explain the water meme that\\'s been going around before the miami gp?\\', \\'anyone going to baku?

if not, is it possible (with current system)?\", \"ok so we know that track time is limited in f1 cars. the only times they can practice is during fp1 etc.but what\\'s dripping them from getting in an f2 car and taking it out to get a feel for the track?\", \\'does anyone know anything about the relationship in the garage at alfa?

       " '\\'english versionfor the first time, a formula 1 race weekend will take place in miami. the route in the sunshine state is therefore completely unknown - the drivers could only test it using the simulator.the fans are all the more excited about the performance of the individual camps and which updates can be expected. after the debacle in imola, special focus is on mercedes and lewis hamilton, for whom the new terrain in florida could also be an opportunity.opponent red bull, on the other hand, is on top after the double victory in the autodromo enzo e dino ferrari. world champion max verstappen won ahead of teammate sergio perez and at the same time caused disillusionment at the scuderia, which could not live up to its expectations at the ferrari home game.world championship leader charles leclerc finished sixth, carlos sainz retired.nevertheless, the outcome of the coming race weekend - not least because of the unfamiliar track - is completely open.said street circuit, the miami international autodrome, which runs around the hard rock stadium of the miami dolphins, has many challenging corners and a 1.28 km long straight ready, in which top speeds of up to 320 km/h can be reached. three drs zones also provide a spectacle.the pay tv station broadcasts the race\\', \"i\\'m just glad mazepin is not racing this track.feel bad for latifi already tho.\"']"
