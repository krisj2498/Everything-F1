       "['Translated by DeepL\\n\\nThe FIA is going to enforce more strictly the rule that drivers are not allowed to wear jewelry and wear their own non-fireproof clothing. Indeed, it will become part of the technical inspection of the car.\\n\\nIt was before the Australian Grand Prix that the driver notes, prepared by the race director, highlighted some already existing rules. Drivers were not allowed to wear jewelry, nor were they allowed to wear their own clothing that was not homologated by the FIA. Lewis Hamilton, among others, took umbrage and indicated that he would in fact be wearing more, while Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff was surprised by the new race directors\\' focus points: \"Is this the battle they want to take on Hamilton now? Well, if this is the worst, we\\'re not complaining.\"\\n\\nTeams now actually risk a penalty\\n\\nThat mention of rules that have been in place for a long time had to be read as a warning at the time, as it now appears. Now, in fact, the FIA is going a step further. Before the start of each weekend, the teams have to sign a document declaring that the car complies with the technical regulations. Now, however, two additional passages have been included on that form. The teams have to declare that the drivers do not wear any jewelry and therefore do not wear their own clothing. RacingNews365 has seen the document with these new passages.\\n\\nThese two aspects are now part of the technical inspection of the cars, which means that if they are not met, the team\\'s registration must be considered \\'illegal\\'. Normally, this will result in an exclusion from the race, but in practice it is possible that a fine or a grid penalty will be imposed.\\n\\n\\nToto Wolff already reacted to the shifting of the rules in the presence of RacingNews365 and has now expressed a more nuanced opinion: \"We have to remember why the FIA is doing this, namely to prevent injuries caused by jewelry. Nobody is waiting for a freak accident in which that plays a part, so the FIA has to draw a line somewhere. Is this a key issue? I don\\'t think so, but I understand where it\\'s coming from.\"',\n",

Being in the middle bewteen both approaches allows them to attract new teams, as theres development on the table, while keeping the costs reasonable. Its a similar approach to what Formula E has been chasing lately. \\n\\nThe ‘spec series’ part of the equation allows IndyCar to have close racing. Despite being in a Meyer Shank car or in a Dayle Coyne car you still have the chance to fighg for pole positions and race wins. That’s something which doesn’t happen on series with ‘open development’. \\n\\nHaving free development on shocks and dampers doesn’t make IndyCar a series focused on ‘open development’. It’s a very important part of the car, but it’s not the *whole* car. Letting IndyCar teams fully develop the chassis and have special partnerships with engine manufacturers would only skyrocket the operational costs of IndyCar. \\n\\nFor all intents and purposes, IndyCar is still considered as a ‘spec series’ because of the same chassis, gearbox, body which is ultimately what the spectator and average fan will look for. The racing is still pretty much what you would find on a ‘spec series’ like Formula E or Formula 2. \\n\\nIndyCar is in the middle of the road and that way of operating has been beneficial to them.',\n",

Schumacher was seen as a rising star after his convincing performances against Nikita Masepin in his first year, but has stagnated somewhat this season.\\n\\nFor so far Schumacher has been pretty much disenchanted by Magnussen. The Dane made his Formula 1 comeback at short notice after a year out and has scored points in three out of four races so far. Magnussen has already scored 15 points, while Schumacher, along with Nicholas Latifi, is one of only two regular drivers without points.\\n\\n\"Mick\\'s future depends in many ways on the comparison with Kevin,\" Coulthard told the Dutch edition of \\'Motorsport.com\\' at an IWC Schaffhausen charity event at Miami Beach Golf Club.\\n\\n\"When you get into Formula One you are given a rookie year, but then you have to deliver,\" the Scot said. \"People don\\'t wait for you to be quick. You have to be.\"\\n\\n**Mick beats Magnussen \"only with hard work\"**\\n\\nSo far, the German\\'s career has actually gone to plan: Schumacher was champion in Formula 3 and Formula 2 and, according to Coulthard, also had a \"very good first season in which he established himself.\"\\n\\nThe unknown, however, was the comparison with team-mate Nikita Masepin. Schumacher was clearly in control of the latter, though the Haas was too slow to compete with other cars. But with the arrival of Magnussen and the better performance of Haas, there is now a comparison - and in that Schumacher is currently still inferior.\\n\\n\"In Kevin he now has someone he can only beat with hard work,\" says Coulthard, preferring to highlight the Dane\\'s performance rather than belittle that of his predecessor Masepin. \"The fact that he\\'s consistently getting the Haas into the points shows that it was the right decision to bring him back.\"\\n\\n**Coulthard: Magnussen drives \"liberated\"**\\n\\nBut the fact that he currently has such a grip on Schumacher also surprises the former vice world champion. He explains it in such a way that Magnussen had actually already finished with Formula 1 and is now getting another unexpected second chance in which he has nothing to lose.\\n\\n\"It seems he is driving liberated,\" he says. \"In his first career with McLaren and Haas, there was always some anger in his style.\"\\n\\nNow, however, Magnussen is simply driving consistently well and is 3-1 up against Schumacher in both qualifying and race duels (go to overview). \"Mick has had it quite easy against Masepin so far, but now he has realised that he has a fast team-mate in Kevin. And that has pushed Mick. He has to step up now,\" said Coulthard.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s a fascinating battle. It will be interesting to see how Haas will develop.\"',\n",

       "'Translated by DeepL\\n\\nThe FIA is going to enforce more strictly the rule that drivers are not allowed to wear jewelry and wear their own non-fireproof clothing. Indeed, it will become part of the technical inspection of the car.\\n\\nIt was before the Australian Grand Prix that the driver notes, prepared by the race director, highlighted some already existing rules. Drivers were not allowed to wear jewelry, nor were they allowed to wear their own clothing that was not homologated by the FIA. Lewis Hamilton, among others, took umbrage and indicated that he would in fact be wearing more, while Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff was surprised by the new race directors\\' focus points: \"Is this the battle they want to take on Hamilton now? Well, if this is the worst, we\\'re not complaining.\"\\n\\nTeams now actually risk a penalty\\n\\nThat mention of rules that have been in place for a long time had to be read as a warning at the time, as it now appears. Now, in fact, the FIA is going a step further. Before the start of each weekend, the teams have to sign a document declaring that the car complies with the technical regulations. Now, however, two additional passages have been included on that form. The teams have to declare that the drivers do not wear any jewelry and therefore do not wear their own clothing. RacingNews365 has seen the document with these new passages.\\n\\nThese two aspects are now part of the technical inspection of the cars, which means that if they are not met, the team\\'s registration must be considered \\'illegal\\'. Normally, this will result in an exclusion from the race, but in practice it is possible that a fine or a grid penalty will be imposed.\\n\\n\\nToto Wolff already reacted to the shifting of the rules in the presence of RacingNews365 and has now expressed a more nuanced opinion: \"We have to remember why the FIA is doing this, namely to prevent injuries caused by jewelry. Nobody is waiting for a freak accident in which that plays a part, so the FIA has to draw a line somewhere. Is this a key issue? I don\\'t think so, but I understand where it\\'s coming from.\" “So, What’s the dress code”? \\n“Business Racing” Inspired by the colour of flag that he will see more of this season. The checkered sleeves are a homage to the type of flag he used to see ahead of others in the past seasons. Aaaaaaaaaaand as always, he looks like a pretentious knob... This is half the reason I don\\'t like the guy, he\\'s always got to try and make a statement The sleeve reminded me of HP sponsored Williams Is “his blue outfit” a thing…? Bruh how is this man not sweating buckets? Hamilton switching to Corvette Racing in IMSA confirmed. Zhou\\'s shorts are stylish [Instagram story of both of them]( I think Max is wearing his GF’s glasses 6 drivers, 3 cars, the Red Bull academy has too many drivers, not enough seats. Jesus, look at the Williams’ top speed. If only they could figure the rest out Williams: The best or nothing. Dont forget to peg Bottas as your Monaco winner in fantasy! Note, These are broad categories, thus not every corner type is accounted for. McLaren for example excel in Medium-High speed corners and medium-Low, however this is not included to make it more simple. Very surprising that Mercedes showed up so well in medium and high speed corners as well as on the straights. It would seem that porpoising would prove the most disruptive there. These look correct Haas does it\\'s best on Medium speed corner, what track is best for that?

Maybe a bit out of place, but it’s great I love the Duracell design. Until the brakes explode... Hope they fixed that issue... [Original Res Photo]( I suspect they need to reduce drag, as the car is designed to gain most of its downforce trough the floor. Less drag could also result in less porpoising, as we see DRS also results in less porpoising. The downside is that they lose downforce in general. So if they can’t fully utilize their floor, they car is just flawed beyond repair. The best, or nothing. Are all of the Merc changes marginal / incremental this far in 2022? Yup thats it, thats the key. Let’s fucking go I guess this is a good time for Ben to see how things are being run over in America?

MotoGP satellite teams don\\'t buy chassis\\' (Moto2/Moto3 teams do howevever), they buy entire bikes with motors, gearbox and all from factories. It’s close enough to a spec series to call it one. And being a spec series isn’t negative, the actual racing in Indy is fantastic As a massive Indycar fan, it is essentially a spec series. IndyCar is a spec series though. K sir, this is a wendy\\'s Much like FE, it’s a mostly spec series. I suppose this post was meant to be posted in r/IndyCar.\\n\\nIndyCar is between being a ‘spec series’ and an ‘open development’ series. Being in the middle bewteen both approaches allows them to attract new teams, as theres development on the table, while keeping the costs reasonable. Its a similar approach to what Formula E has been chasing lately. \\n\\nThe ‘spec series’ part of the equation allows IndyCar to have close racing. Despite being in a Meyer Shank car or in a Dayle Coyne car you still have the chance to fighg for pole positions and race wins. That’s something which doesn’t happen on series with ‘open development’. \\n\\nHaving free development on shocks and dampers doesn’t make IndyCar a series focused on ‘open development’. It’s a very important part of the car, but it’s not the *whole* car. Letting IndyCar teams fully develop the chassis and have special partnerships with engine manufacturers would only skyrocket the operational costs of IndyCar. \\n\\nFor all intents and purposes, IndyCar is still considered as a ‘spec series’ because of the same chassis, gearbox, body which is ultimately what the spectator and average fan will look for. The racing is still pretty much what you would find on a ‘spec series’ like Formula E or Formula 2. \\n\\nIndyCar is in the middle of the road and that way of operating has been beneficial to them. I\\'ve been getting into the ferrari challenge series. It is a super spec series.   The cars are 100% identical and yet there are still like 10 static adjustments you can make and 6 real-time adjustments. \\n\\nSpec means that the cars are mostly identical as opposed to \"open\" or \"box\" designs.\\n\\nIndy falls closest to the \"Spec\" category.

That’s some actual king shit Alright this ones actually pretty sick That\\'s gifting him about 20lbs That’s the same cloth as blue flags My boy like to train Agility. I usually am amused at his outfits but this one is just really bad ahahahah Mans won the fit battle this week this shit\\'s just goofy do we have a sub just for Lewis\\' drips? i\\'m all in for it. Hahaha! Not climate-friendly manufacturing new clothes every day The man should focus on his car as much as he does his clothes… perhaps then he could match Russell. Looks like a dork The court Jester has arrived. Is it a minute behind the frontrunners? Really dig it (bar the strap) - how much is it? a million? Wonder if it bounces up and down on your wrist if you move your arm. I love the colors but watch prices are a bit too much for me If they did the watch face in the Petronas blue, it would have been like the Tiffany Nautilus. Quality of the images are pretty poor, but I\\'m very glad to see the introduction of the Duracell colours. Blue and copper is a hot combo How long until the Williams mechanics strip that paint off to save weight? Nice idea! Original Res Photos - [Photo](  [Photo 2]( That\\'s a very cool paint job - it immediately invokes batteries. Well done to the designer. Man, the picture in the replies is great. Looks fantastic. Those cheap bastards using a combination of left AND right corners to design their track… Glad they did not replicate the tyre-shredder roundabout Where is the top view. Hanoi was an absolutely brutal track in F1 2020. Couldn\\'t stand it.\\n\\nMiami thankfully looks to have better flow. Wait so Hanoi isn\\'t real? I\\'ve been hating a fake track for years? So? Nice catch ! When I watched the Miami F1 2022 gameplay, I was genuinely confused for a moment thinking it was was Vietnam lol Valtteri’s social media shenanigans don’t get enough appreciation, but dudes more active than almost any other driver on the grid when it comes to random witty/enjoyable content! It’s incredible! You can see the Instagram video of this [here](\\n\\nValtteri is clearly having fun xD He really is living his best life these days, isn\\'t he? Good for him! In all fairness to the pose, he is about the size of one of their cheerleaders So, is there a sports team in and around the Miami area that an F1 driver hasn\\'t been to see in the past 4 days? VB always looks like one of the biggest drivers,  but those dudes make him look tiny! No Tua in sight.\\n\\nESPN later today: F1 driver also hates Tua Brazzers Bottas, a fin with the fins. Laces out. This has way too much NSFW meme potential. And you know exactly what im talking about. Man, being on Mercedes REALLY suppressed Valterri’s public character. Alfa seems fun Leaving that porpoising tractor has been the best decision ever for Bottas.\\nHe looks joyful! Laces out! LACES OUT! need a picture of Valtteri with Christian Wilkins Leaving that porpoising tractor has been the best decision ever for Bottas.\\nHe looks joyful! he really loves that alpha shirt lol These F1 guys are so gosh darn cuddly! looks like the intro of a porn movie XD Just some guys being dudes Lol, F1 drivers are tiny. Well, at least it\\'s not weird... No no no. I love how it’s about racing & fun, so tired of people on social media pushing their personal agendas. HAMBURG, May 5 (Reuters)- An agreement for Volkswagen\\'s (VOWG_p.DE) premium brand Audi to join Formula One by investing in British luxury sports carmaker McLaren is becoming increasingly unlikely, a person familiar with the project told Reuters on Thursday.\\n\\n\"The price expectations are too far apart,\" the person said, adding that while the project had not yet failed, its prospects are now close to zero.\\n\\nMeanwhile, talks with Swiss-based Sauber, which runs the Ferrari-powered Alfa Romeo team, and Williams are continuing, the person said. Both Audi and Volkswagen declined to comment. A tale as old as time Always has been I see that McLaren is doing everything to be customer and have almost 0 % chance for title fight. Is this a sabotage or something ? I really hope they buy Williams they could use a helping hand... More detail on new wing changes from Scarbs [More analysis on new FW by Scarbs]( These just some regular downforce adaptations to a track rather then a true differentiator of airflow or something radical Are these the radical changes Mercedes is gonna bring to become P1 again? They can’t change the nose without a new crash test right? So the 3 kg is all in the wings/wingtips? I honestly don’t see 3 kg there but whatev Is this the only update they brought? You can polish a turd but at the end of the day it’s still a piece of shit Old looks better.... FUTURRRRREEE Face Lift Mario Party Mini Game It\\'s Florida, there\\'s always a chance for rain, it\\'s what happens when you build your state on a swamp. That pretty normal for this time of year.  This is actually good, bit hot, weather for Miami.  This is just showing there is the chance for a quick 30min-1hr pop us shower.  Very heavy rain chance but it is usually quick. It\\'s a peninsula.  It rains frequently.  I lived there for a few years, and it\\'s super common for a single cloud to roll through and drop an inch or two of rain in the span of 30 minutes then go back to sunny. Weather apps doesn\\'t tell us a lot... they\\'re all based of a computer model with no human input. Just watch the TV meteorologist or check NWS Miami on the morning of race. Source: I\\'m a meteorologist. When I lived in God’s Waiting Room, it seemed to rain everyday in the morning and afternoon for a 20 minute shower. 39% chance of getting 7 one hundredths of an inch = rain in the forecast?! We might get some real water in the marina! Surprised nobody has made a joke about the fake marina yet Yes…maybe…meh 40% chance of rain with a high of 90F lmao. Event goers are about to know what it feels like to lose 10lb in an afternoon Florida weather.  It could rain real hard for a couple of minutes or it could do that nearby and completely miss you.  It’s pretty random. The lights make it look cool I like this one! It’s different than the traditional blue and pink theme. It’s clean.

They do have some very outlandish opinions sometimes but they have a good crew of former F1 race car designers and people that were involved with F1 for years. I enjoy it. Missed Apex is the way.  Matt Trumpets (NYC guy) in particular is a knowledgeable yet very understandable F1 pundit. Idk if it\\'s the best, but Shift+F1 have a primer episode to get you informed. It\\'s episode 178. Missed Apex gets my vote. \\n\\nAlso, i would just skip to season 4 of D2S and watch it. It\\'s interesting to see where the teams finished and where they\\'re at currently. F1 nation (official F1 race preview and reviews), especially the race reviews got a lot better this year with direct interviews from the paddock with drivers and other team personnel. Missed Apex and F1: Beyond the Grid. Any time Joe Saward is on Missed Apex is what you should listen to I like Scuderia F1 podcast Missed Apex is my favorite. The panel is great and occasionally hilarious. Shift+F1 podcast.\\n\\nIt’s a longterm US podcast but very accessible. They have a pre-season primer episode to get you up to speed. I quite enjoy Missed Apex. They can be biased towards Lewis (especially end of 2021) at times but I enjoy the structure of their podcast and they\\'re usually the first to get a show out after the race. \\n\\nI also like the Ringer F1 Show. WTF1 just watch donut media\\'s video on youtube, on f1. Its really good, and WTF1 has good information for beginners too. Glad to have you in this community and i hope you start loving the sport we all fell in love with here <3 You definitely need to binge watch DTS S4 from last season before/as you fly down there. Also, like other have said episode 178 from ShiftF1 is all you’ll need to listen to! I\\'d recommend back of the grid if you\\'re a brit Not a podcast, but Chain Bear on YouTube and B Sport also on YouTube have some great explanation vids on aerodynamics, track regulations, tyres, porpoising, that type of stuff Ask in daily thread. Contrast and compair Zak to some of the other CEO\\'s and damn is he an amazing personality in the sport. God I wish that were me...\\n\\nAlso didn\\'t F1 ban plane flybys this season ? I was super bummed when they announced it There are pilots and then there are the Blue Angels, [who are absolutely insane]( Wonder if Daniel or Lando would’ve wanted to go but Zak was like “Drivers can’t go. Too risky. Oh by the way: I’m available!” Thhe Blue Angels is the only thing I’ve seen in person that rivals F1/INDYCAR at speed.  Truly death-defying Amazingly, Blue Angels shows and Top Gun movies are net positives for the US Department of Defense.  That is actually your tax dollars working for you!  The recruitment benefit outweighs the expense. \\n\\nAlso, the Blue Angels are the most bad ass flying formation in the world... but there is a reason the Navy won\\'t allow the Airforce\\'s F-22 to fly at naval Airshows....  it is the most stunning and maneuverable airplane that will ever be built by humankind. Zak definitely seems to be living his best life these days. Also seems like he\\'s been dropping weight lately, no? I feel the need… Man is living life. Would be really cool to be a multi millionaire [deleted] [Original Res Photo]( There are many posts showing this particular car, it\\'s the Renault Rs20 from the 2020 season, not the a521 Its got both drivers numbers on too No comment after 2 hours? How are you planning on organising this gathering lol? Flea market display with Gucci prices. $450 for a t-shirt 💀\\n\\nHaas offering their caps for $30 is the only reasonable thing I remember at the Hungary GP when I was 10 I begged my parents to get me a Lewis Hamilton McLaren cap. They told me it\\'s too expensive, but they got me one, it was 20€. Buying the haas cap, cant afford to be a better fan than that. Is that $130 for the purple mercedes hat or is there something below it? That can\\'t be right TIL my budget is “Haas” Even if I had it, I wouldn’t spend that kind of money on a that. McLaren Racing F1 New Era 940 2022 Special Edition Fade Miami Hat Is $42 on Amazon fyi Lol slap that tiny F1 logo = $110.. Gtfo Im good lol Haas first year cap for \\\\~40% of new big Team caps? Yes please That\\'s a big premium on the merch. Gene gaining some fans 🇺🇲🇺🇸🇩🇪🇩🇰🏁🙏 Statistically speaking, how often is a sucker born? Wow really judging my past self for scoffing at $20+ cocktail drinks at COTA in 2016-2019 range that even included the nice glass it came in. This weekend is going to be all sorts of level of stupid and throwing huge amounts of money away it will drive people crazy There’s always someone stupid enough to buy. those prices make me think this is a tent outside of the track somewhere trying to scalp people - i dont think these are actual f1 shop prices There’s a sucker born every minute 30 bucks Haas cap lets gooooo F1flation $80 for a year old cap? Seems about right Eff that. $450 for a 6 button tshirt? Hell no. I\\'ve dropped some serious coin at Texas GP before, but I went home with a lot of stuff. This is BS. Looks like the same prices as Austin last year. I got my cheap-ass $40 Austin Grand Prix hat and loved it...until my dog ate it. If I had spent $130, I might have wished the hat ate the dog, since he\\'d be cheaper to replace. There’s a huge markup on this stuff. You can buy the same shit on their websites for much less. Probably the venue taking their cut here Is this possibly a stand that’s outside the track? Or is this an official stand? Pretty similar to COTA last year. Looking like I’d be rooting for Haas! HAAS for the people This is USD?! Jesus that is ridiculous, prices are probably going to be outrageous at the Montreal grand prix. You should look into America\\'s Cup merchandise. This garbage in Miami is targeted at millionaires. Pfft. I pity.  America\\'s Cup merch is targeted at mega-millionaires. \\n\\nFor a half a second I almost considered getting a $230 Prada America\\'s Cup t-shirt after a friendgirl said, \"yeah, but, I\\'m pretty sure that is the least expensive Prada product ever offered for sale. You might want to buy a few\"\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m broker than shit, I\\'m just really into sailing. Everyone that reads this post should look into the AC.  If you didn\\'t know, 95% of AC fans are F1 fans but only like 1% of F1 fans are AC fans.  AC and F1 are very similar; they\\'re all about rules, design, engineering, and fluid dynamics.  But the AC has both aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. \\n\\nIf you like F1, you will like the America\\'s Cup. It\\'s priced similarly to other prestige events like The Masters, America\\'s cup, etc. \\n\\nPeter Millar is just a scam tho. Nothing could make me buy their sportswear. All of this shit is way cheaper online 80 for a hat.? 110 for a shirt.?! 🤣🤣🤣 ok I scared to even convert dollars to my currency It’s all Putin’s fault! First time at a GP? They’re always insanely expensive. Went to Austin in 2018 and 2019 and the hats were $60, shirts and jackets were $80-120. That was 3-4 years ago, add inflation and popularity and you have todays prices. Peter Millar isn’t cheap, but a 1/4 zip pullover isn’t $450. It’s $150 tops Are these prices standard for buying at the event location? I was planning to buy merch at the Canadian GP but it looks like I can only afford Haas 🥴 Polo better come with a hooker F1 is for the rich. Those prices are a joke lol This is what happens when Americans buy the sport. SMH. Fans are counted as revenue streams only. F1 and Miami two things that aren\\'t cheap honestly these prices are pretty close to normal nfl Merch in Miami at a game. If you worry about prices Miami isn\\'t for you. I just don\\'t understand the appeal. It all looks like tat to me. My wallet is pleased. What the actual fuck And prices will only go up through the weekend. Bro ☠️ Heading down there now. Clearly will not be buying any merch and am going to eat a large breakfast and lunch. just buy them on aliexpress few bucks Ridiculous, basic shirts with a logo on it, not even cool designs or whatever... WTF? That can’t be real?! Bwoah merc white cap is free right? right? Yet another reason to support Haas and Gunther\\'s Go Fund Me for a new boat Teams overcoming budget cap with overpriced merch prices /s That\\'s just sad, driving people away from representing their brand. When I was in Imola this year, the Ferrari baseball caps were 60€ and Mercedes 40€, and I thought that was outrageous lol. Does anyone buy these at these prices? Beer goggle pricing. Surely they would make more money in the long run by lowering the price?\\nThis is nonsense Modern day pricing is usually based on demand-supply rather than a fixed margin over cost. That\\'s why so many mega companies grow in value so much because they keep reducing their costs, keep increasing their margins and keep increasing their prices. While a cap might be $30 on the website, they know they if you don\\'t have it and you wanna flaunt your support for a team, you are gonna get it even at a premium. Hence the inflated costs for things that are relatively less expensive online That’s insane! I know merch prices don’t reflect all prices but man I feel at this rate I’ll never be able to afford to go a f1 race in the US. Between travel and price of tickets for more than 1 person it just isn’t possible unless I’m looking in the wrong place. I remeber going to us GP COTA and hats being like 45 dollars and that was 2016 inflation hasnt gone up that much. $110 dollars for a t-shirt kind of pricey f1 \\n\\nhow much is the program like 90 dollars Not abnormal for races in North America. I went to Montreal in 2010 and prices were insane even then. $70 for a hat, $110 for a shirt, and $200 for a jacket Lmao what! Fanatics has this all Where\\'s that famous budget cap That white polo is legitimately more than a third of my monthly rent Definitely would cop that Haas hat! I am so embarrassed for this whole event so far. I see supply and demand is in full effect regarding the Haas  hat. Always knew supporting haas would pay me back somehow haha Wait until this guy finds out how much pimento cheese sandwiches are at the masters lol Miami GP is F1 attempting a total cash grab from the American elite.  And I get it, F1 cars are expensive.  Bummer middle-class fans are getting gouged for souvenirs. Cheaper than in Brazil GP at least. Well that\\'s gross. I love F1 but I feel like attending a race in person or buying the Merch is targeted for the Uber wealthy Damn I\\'ll take that HAAS hat for $30! Are those online anywhere? I remember Liberty Media saying they wanted to treat each race like the way the NFL does with the super bowl. These prices would back that claim. Christ they cant be serious...$250 for a polo, i know inflation is bad but dam not that bad Why’d they do my haas like that?! The Crack mentality continues right down the food chain Haas being real ones I’d take a HAAS hat What. The. Fuck. I’d buy the Haas hat Do they not sell Pirelli caps at the race? what does the $450 shirt do? I mean... I have two kidneys, so... I\\'m kind of glad everything is expensive. Now i don\\'t have to worry about spending any money while at the event I guess if you can afford >$2k ticket you can spend 450 on a fking polo… god damn The team hats seem to be about the same prices they were at COTA in October. I’ve never seen generic F1 merch so overpriced though. Everyday Indycar becomes more and more appealing to me I mean apart from the polos….. have you been to a concert recently? \"Inflation\" I own zero merch because of their BS prices. BRO THOSE HAAS PRICES BE BANGIN!!! Haas with the closest to a reasonable hat price Sorry but 450 for THAT?? Whoa. I remember going to Silverstone 2019 and it costing £80 for any teams t-shirt. Absolute joke, I ended up getting a senna hoodie for £30 instead because if it. Don\\'t let them rip you off. Jesus christ. Meanwhile it looks like a flea market in a third world country I always found it interesting that the Seminole Indian tribe now completely owns Hard Rock International. this makes miami RB’s fifth home race on the calendar Looks like the hump at the chicane took max off guard! That long straight is just a showcase of the car\\'s straight-line speed considering there\\'s no way to set yourself coming out of that chicane. Professor Max :) His ease at the wheel almost makes you think he does this kind of thing for a living. I enjoyed the commentary on it as well.\\n\\nHope those two kerbs aren\\'t so big in real life or his underbody might be in for a world of pain Looks cool. Very long straight. I assume he’s in Assetto Corsa running laps? I can’t really tell what sim he’s in but I know AC has a mod with the track. Interesting. In the other Sim laps videos that RB posts I mentioned how he has a little twerk of his leg whenever he goes full throttle. \\n\\nI actually found a video from a Mexican pr thing with Albon where you could see both drivers legs. Max did it as well Alex didn\\'t.  But in this video no twerk. Or maybe it\\'s the camera angle right between his legs? Is that the actual Red Bull sim? That chicane is like a cannon! [Comparison between the new rear wing and the old one via Duchessa]( Dear lord even more colors popping on that Merc car..  I think it’s the same front wing but with a different adjustment They should replace the Petronas accent colors with these new color patterns. Weird livery Seeing magnussen do well is such a great story. So incredibly happy for him. Hopefully Mick can bring his performance at least on par with K Mags. It certainly does. Schumacher is in a car that can score points and he\\'s failed to deliver so far. **David Coulthard: Mick Schumacher\\'s future depends on Magnussen duel**\\n\\n**If Mick Schumacher wants a future in Formula 1, he must not look old against Kevin Magnussen - The Dane is a surprise for David Coulthard**\\n\\nAuthor: Norman Fischer\\n\\nCo-Author: Erwin Jaeggi\\n\\n05.05.2022, 17:25\\n\\n**David Coulthard: Mick Schumacher\\'s future depends on Magnussen duel**\\n\\nMick Schumacher\\'s future in Formula One depends heavily on how he fares against his Haas team-mate Kevin Magnussen, says former driver David Coulthard. Schumacher was seen as a rising star after his convincing performances against Nikita Masepin in his first year, but has stagnated somewhat this season.\\n\\nFor so far Schumacher has been pretty much disenchanted by Magnussen. The Dane made his Formula 1 comeback at short notice after a year out and has scored points in three out of four races so far. Magnussen has already scored 15 points, while Schumacher, along with Nicholas Latifi, is one of only two regular drivers without points.\\n\\n\"Mick\\'s future depends in many ways on the comparison with Kevin,\" Coulthard told the Dutch edition of \\'Motorsport.com\\' at an IWC Schaffhausen charity event at Miami Beach Golf Club.\\n\\n\"When you get into Formula One you are given a rookie year, but then you have to deliver,\" the Scot said. \"People don\\'t wait for you to be quick. You have to be.\"\\n\\n**Mick beats Magnussen \"only with hard work\"**\\n\\nSo far, the German\\'s career has actually gone to plan: Schumacher was champion in Formula 3 and Formula 2 and, according to Coulthard, also had a \"very good first season in which he established himself.\"\\n\\nThe unknown, however, was the comparison with team-mate Nikita Masepin. Schumacher was clearly in control of the latter, though the Haas was too slow to compete with other cars. But with the arrival of Magnussen and the better performance of Haas, there is now a comparison - and in that Schumacher is currently still inferior.\\n\\n\"In Kevin he now has someone he can only beat with hard work,\" says Coulthard, preferring to highlight the Dane\\'s performance rather than belittle that of his predecessor Masepin. \"The fact that he\\'s consistently getting the Haas into the points shows that it was the right decision to bring him back.\"\\n\\n**Coulthard: Magnussen drives \"liberated\"**\\n\\nBut the fact that he currently has such a grip on Schumacher also surprises the former vice world champion. He explains it in such a way that Magnussen had actually already finished with Formula 1 and is now getting another unexpected second chance in which he has nothing to lose.\\n\\n\"It seems he is driving liberated,\" he says. \"In his first career with McLaren and Haas, there was always some anger in his style.\"\\n\\nNow, however, Magnussen is simply driving consistently well and is 3-1 up against Schumacher in both qualifying and race duels (go to overview). \"Mick has had it quite easy against Masepin so far, but now he has realised that he has a fast team-mate in Kevin. And that has pushed Mick. He has to step up now,\" said Coulthard.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s a fascinating battle. It will be interesting to see how Haas will develop.\" No. Very cool, thanks! How do you find out about the pop ups? The Race: \"Is Lewis Outmatched by Guanyu? A ~~sith~~ drip lord? Boy got drip. Can’t deny. What lot is that sneakerheads?

Damn there\\'s no way it\\'s that hot there where at in miami? What´ s with the W13? The floor is different, the previous Side Pods but on the other hand a new and much thinner rear wing? Here\\'s hoping they dial back the sensationalism somewhat.  Seems like some drivers and teams are pretty upset about last season and less footage isn\\'t going to help them.  They definitely could have made a more compelling (i.e. true) story out of last season I think. One episode will be about the rivalry between Latifi and walls I feel like best case scenario is they mend some bridges with a less sensationalised season 5 and season 6 goes back to what it once was.\\n\\nOtherwise, it\\'ll just be Red Bull, Steiner, Christian Horner, Zak Brown, Geri Horner, Danny Ric and Christian Horner by the end Guaranteed that Miami gets its own episode Hopefully the series reinvents itself because it desperatly needs to.\\n\\nThe quality has been on a decline since S1. Steady at first with S2 then sharper with S3 and off a cliff with S4. Season 4 was for sure the weakest, but hopefully they & F1 / Liberty / FOM take any criticism from fans and the teams to refine the format. I just need Toto to say Pumpernickel once an episode. I don\\'t think it\\'s an unreasonable request. I’m pretty sure by the end of those 2 seasons no drivers will be willing to participate. They haven’t been happy with their portrayal on the large This last season was so bad. I hope they rethink how they are doing things. I hope the attrocious reception of the latest season prompts them to dial down the fake drama and focus on the real stuff a bit more. I can\\'t fathom how they managed to fuck up the last season, the perfect material for a banger of a season was right there and instead they focused on Mazepin\\'s early pitstop... They also manged to anger some drivers, which could have been easily avoided. Hell, ask some of them about their best moments and tough battles and you might even start endearing yourself to them. Will Buxton on Twitter 😂 \\n\\n 2 more years of having to hear about people who hate the series so much that they wont watch They should expand the number of ~~races~~ episodes Hope 5 & 6 are better than 4. That last one was a snorefest. I\\'m here for more Haas episodes. Season V: Guenther strikes back. Hopefully they\\'ll take some of the criticisms on board and focus on storylines that are actually happening instead of just manipulating the footage and the interviews to tell whatever narrative they want to tell.  \\n.  \\n.  \\n.  \\n.  \\n.  \\n.  \\n.  \\n.  \\n\\nAnd while we\\'re wishing for far fetched things; I want a date with Gahyeon from Dreamcatcher. Can\\'t wait to watch about heroic Prince Charles slaying the Satan Max next season! Here\\'s to 2 more seasons that releases during the season opener rather than the season break where it would be more sensible to watch. Formula 1 gatekeepers in shambles 😐😐😐 It’s pretty early to confirm, and for the first time it comes with 2 seasons. Do we know what happened in the meeting between drivers and Netflix?\\n\\n[ I enjoyed the series but I\\'m really, really hoping that Geri Horner is boycotting S5 & S6. I had to FF through so much Country Life footage last season. No surprises but christ they need to step up the content quality Oh no. It\\'s getting worse each season. I think that they should do a second Netflix show that’s more serious. DTS is a great hook but there’s room for more content. \\n\\nIt would be really cool if they could do a deep dive and follow one time for a whole year. By the 6th season all the drivers will not want to be featured so it’s going to be all actors pretending to be the drivers with 100% made up storyline’s. And another 2 seasons of manipulative pictures of F1. Can\\'t wait to not watch Here’s to hoping they stop with the fabricated bullshit when they have enough content to produce a good series with the drama they already have. (And less Susie Wolff please it’s Drive to Survive not Manage to Survive) Still don\\'t understand why we need more fake drama in newer seasons if it\\'s mainly to attract new fans. Are they gonna start the show from Season 5? As someone who doesn\\'t give a fuck about this show, let me just do my old man moaning:   \\nWhy the fuck am I getting a \"BREAKING NEWS\" push notification on my Formula One racing app to tell me some Netflix show is coming back for another two seasons?  \\nUgh. Another thread of copy and pasted comments in every Netflix thread. Like an actual game of Reddit bingo. \\n\\nI’ve liked every season enough, they don’t owe me anything. The show is what it is, if you don’t like the format then stop watching. Just realised, if they continue down the route of over-dramatisation, they are probably going to use Lando\\'s sarcastic comments in some stupid, convoluted way. Should set the record straight on how the powers that be feel about the series. Lot of people were using vague reports to insinuate that the series was unpopular and done for.\\n\\nDTS has been an overwhelmingly positive thing for the sport and for the smaller teams and lesser known drivers in particular.

Hope it documents the races a bit more and the way it sways from race to race rather than make up rivalries and force things on us!\\nDon’t mind the BTS stuff if it actually includes more stuff about the car and ermmm the racing aspect Season 4 was average, given the season was crazy!

This is super interesting. Are there any other teams or maybe drivers on tik-tok? Would love this kind of content on my feed. Aston has a very good social media presence for their behind the scenes stuff. Not a fan of the team but I’m subscribed to their YouTube channel for all of the videos they put out. Great share r/specializedtools I really do love the behind the scenes looks that TikTok has brought us. It’s stuff that even 5 years ago would have been invisible to the average viewer just because nobody thought to cover it. I need a lot more content like this. The irony of tiktok, a platform filled with teenagers and kids being where F1 teams showcase this kind of technical stuff is really funny I always wonder what they meant by +1 and +2 etc for wings. Like is it cm? Mm? Or just whatever unit they use. And can they go 0.5 maybe The changes don’t look too drastic. I’m curious as to how that small angle affects the aero load on the FW. Gif won’t open. Commenting to find it later I have never wanted Tiktok before and now suddenly I discover I need it damn you Aston martin and your super cool informative clip. That was cool as fook But I\\'m pretty sure during race pit stops and/or Indycar they use something akin to an allen wrench?

We know what a bit driver is.  Most of us even have one in the garage. showing a 403 error to me. anyone got a mirror link? Its crazy how much more hype he gets over someone like Palou who won Indy last year and is leading this year. Lot of work to do if he wants to reach F1. Is he quick? No doubt, but he\\'s also erratic and prone to unforced errors (Nashville 2021, Long Beach 2022, Barber 2022 etc). If he can consistently unlock his speed without mistakes he\\'s got a chance but not many drivers can Colton is great but he\\'s got some real early 2018 Verstappen vibes about him, I\\'d say Pato O\\'Ward is a better candidate for a potential seat at McLaren but then again, if its an American they are specifically looking for. [Original Res Photo]( Wonder why he’s not in the car for a practice session this weekend? O’ward is a better driver IMO. So much hype for someone who\\'s still learning to keep his shit together when racing for big points. Herta is an awesome driver and talent, don\\'t get me wrong, but he\\'s still a bit far from being a nice suit for McLaren in the near future. I\\'d love to see him in F1 but I\\'d also love for him to first get more consistent in Indycar, he\\'s such a 2019 Charles Leclerc right now, mega fast but error prone and hotheaded This man\\'s rapid and needs to replace Ricciardo once his contract runs down. McLaren are disappointed with how Ricciardo performed last season citing they don\\'t pay him a large contract to be under-performing. The team is firmly centred around Lando Norris, a delighted Zak Brown exclaims. He should get SL first to think about F1. Plus without at least one season in F2 I do not see his potential F1 time as a success story. Stop trying to make Colton Herta happen, it’s not going to happen. The grid is really young. I don\\'t think it\\'ll be anything easy to get anyone much less him a seat If his # somehow turns out to be 45... I can think of 2 major companies that would throw money at his team.\\n\\nMove over Heineken...the [Las Vegas F1 title sponsor is...]( Let’s not rush a US driver into a seat due to the growth in the US.

That 3rd DRS zone looks really short. It’ll be interesting to see if it’s long enough to give some good overtakes So is there any team that favors this circuit? Long straight looks like redbull power train. Are the minisector lengths determined by the amount of time it takes to complete them? Honestly looks like it could be a cool layout [Via Adam Cooper ](\\n\\n> Some small tweaks from the FIA to the Miami DRS zones even before the cars have run. Detection 1 is 7m later, D2 is 3m earlier, and D3 is 4m earlier. Meanwhile Activation 1 is 37m earlier. Feels a bit weird having the first two DRS detection and activation points on the same straight, given the corners preceding them are the very sort where the trailing car will lose time. Just before T7/8 and just after T13 feels like it would work better from a racing perspective... I swear the track is rotated differently on every map I see Why is the corner in MS04 not a corner but the straight on MS09 have a corner 9? I always wondered how circuit length is determined exactly. My guesses were centerline length or average of inner and outer white line length. Guess they use the centerline. I’ll save this pic, handy to know for when I’m following the mini sectors on the timing app. This circuit actually looks really cool. I\\'d love to see elevation changes but some of the curves are a real classic design. DRS 1&2 could be huge for someone. Turn 10 is gonna be flat out and I can’t understand why you would even call that a turn Why doesn\\'t the map have the pitlane?\\n\\nYou\\'d think that an FIA map would have something that important lol [New Circuit Map](  \\n\\n\\n[Link to official FIA Document](  \\n\\n\\nEdit: For reference, [here\\'s]( the old circuit map It\\'s nice that the DRS detection points are all after a corner rather than before so you can\\'t play DRS games on the brakes in the same way they did in Jeddah for example, as you\\'ll lose out on the longer flat out sections after the detection points So they\"re longer ?\\n\\nwhy? now I\\'m scared of too easy overtakes even more Will be changed again if it doesn\\'t help Toto enough Why is F1 making DRS zones in to gimmicks? Two zones is fine but for some reason they are adding more and more to make artificial overtakes and drama. Speaks to the failure of these new regs. Rulemakers were saying DRS could well be eliminated with the new ruleset, no DRS on the showcars for a reason right? Instead, DRS is more than ever before; don’t fall for the nonsense folks. All for the \\'spectacle\\' I guess. Miami **needs** to be an overtake fest. These DRS zones, especially between 9-11 and 16-17 seem way too powerful. I do feel the corner being so much more open visually on the inside with the wall moved back will encourage some to send it.         \\nIt\\'s a lot less intimidating. The last 5 cars are quite musical. E A A E Doubt they lift still, kinda like it Honestly if I hadn’t been reading about the renovations I doubt I would have even noticed anything was different (aside from the big-ass grandstands of course).

I suppose it is a little bit different. Lol 😂 it’s the same, kinda Even the GT3\\'s look fast af. F1 needs some more static camera angles like this. Not those 400% too far zoomed in tracking shots.

Make sure Guenther and Kevin don’t drink too much or stuff might get fook smashed everywhere. Are \"opening parties\" something that\\'s done for every track\\'s first race weekend or is this just cuz it\\'s Miami? Never knew this was a thing before a race weekend. What u doing step Fred Seb looks slouchy lol I\\'m actually surprised so many poster designs went with vaporwave/synthwave. I was hoping more of the posters took an interest in art deco architecture, Cuban influences, or even pastel beach scenes. Hell, nobody even did a proper Miami Vice throwback lol The clichés just keep on coming Was hoping for checo firing off an m16 and max doing a line off the front wing r/unixporn has better vaporwave art than this I definitely like the way they have gone with the poster, synthwave I believe but still its really nice This one is nice.  Haas still wins no questions asked everyone complaining about the same theme from all the teams - but I\\'m loving it. Keep \\'em coming!   \\n\\nI wish teams did more one-offs throughout the season than they already do. Especially with helmets - some of them seem so bland for the season and only get creative in the one-offs Love the synthwave vibe. Does anyone know if you can buy these somewhere? I\\'m excited for the inevitable comparison video that shows how inaccurate the Codies version is. They have managed to create a track before it was built yet they still haven\\'t managed to completely rebuilt Spa. Gonna look so realistic with porposing keep landos head away from zhou! This is kind of hilarious. I like the basic design and lack of sponsors. Love the touch of his signature as the commissioner It must be weird going to hold this helmet expecting to feel the grippy, leathery texture of a basketball and instead feeling the cold, slick texture of bare carbon fibre. Love that he did something other than the neon pink and palm trees that everyone else is doing Goofiest helmet design yet. I love it This is so cool it’s almost stupid. Props to Mclaren as well, for giving that much artistic freedom. This is a really cool concept and design. Is there a reason for this though? Is Lando a huge basketball fan? Or cross promotion with nba? Finally an original design If lando gets another podium and all the mechanics congratulate him by tapping on his helmet during parc ferme, it\\'s essential a basketball game Man is gonna look like a GTA character They should paint the T cam into MJ’s palm so it’ll look like he’s bouncing a basketball down the main straight. It\\'s genuinely so awesome. I hope he raffles it away like he did his Monaco helmet Wow that\\'s good, nice to see a big difference in helmet designs from normal. Like it used to be. That is slightly insane. Damn it looks like real ball. That’s hideous I love it so much Went from 🥎 to 🏀 It looks so real The Halloween pumpkin helmet is totally happening irl soon, right? Right?\\n\\nEdit: Missing word \"helmet\" Love Lando for this I can smell this helmet through the internet. WINNER\\n\\n\\nReally, that\\'s awesome and will look great in the orange McLaren. Also many drivers got the pink/blue on their helmets, so this one really standsout! A+ Lando. Superb design and a brilliant idea. Really cool! This is sick! I love when drivers do full concept special helmets (like Dany Ricc\\'s football helmet design for Austin a couple years back) instead of just adjusting the color scheme with a few design tweaks. \\n\\nThis fits so well with the McLaren color scheme as well, wow well done! I’m overwhelmed with different emotions I don\\'t know if this is my favourite this weekend, but it is the most memorable. This is perfect. Especially with the Heat up 2-0 in the series. Okay, I am impressed with Lando for going for that helmet design that is so awesome! This is so smart. I love it! Cooooool. would definitely grab a miniature of this if one is ever made. can i ask a silly question, does this come out of the teams annual budget? I think is the most creative helmet design that I\\'ve ever seen Looks great, best helmet this year Aiyooo that’s fucking awesome This is cool AF!! Love it!! That\\'s one of the coolest helmets I\\'ve ever seen Love it! This is the best and funniest helmet design I think I’ve ever seen I\\'m not normally one to comment on another man\\'s helmet but that my friends is stellar. I fuck with this. It was a tad jarring at first but the more I looked at it the more I liked it. \\n\\nReally different and really cool. Baller Insanity Wow that is amazing, really perfect! Pretty cool how the lines are reminiscent of his usual design. one of the best helmet design right now for me.... i couldn\\'t believe it at first, it looked like they actually attached the leather of a basketball to the helmet... WOW This is legitimately one of the best helmet designs I\\'ve ever seen. This makes me very uncomfortable I mean…this is sick. I love his helmets. This one is great. Just like the pizza helmet. Nailed it. Such a simple idea. r/ATBGE Go Heat! Might be my all time Favorite design! McLaren is lucky there’s porpoising, otherwise they’d be penalized for traveling. Isn\\'t someone at McLaren a part owner of the Phx Suns or something like that. There in the playoffs right now so maybe that\\'s y he has a basketball helmet. Lmfao just wait til we see he\\'s got a custom race suit too\\n\\n I hate this with ball my heart. Not sure if intentional but a cool touch I noticed is how the seams of the basketball design is similar to the blue lines of his regular helmet. The r/nba - r/formula1 crossover we all need Hahaha...wtf What a bizarre idea — and it\\'s freakishly well executed. Me:”Lando Norris will never be ballin’” \\nLando Norris: Brooooooooooooooooo this is absolutely caked in cool OK, that is legitimately the best racing helmet I\\'ve ever seen. I kneel. Sick. Nah this is goated My God, it’s…. it’s…. beautiful 😢 That could\\'ve very easily looked like shit but it\\'s so painstakingly accurate and detailed that I think it works. I like it a lot Much better than the boring 80s neon miami vice GTA style ones. This wouldn’t have made sense if the race is in Seattle r/TIHI Haha this is so much /r/ATBGE [r/ATBGE]( Idk this is like r/ATBGE material to me, it just seems wrong 🤣....you need a better picture for the first one.  I literally thought it was a basketball with visors tape to it. I like it. It is not like basketball is something exclusive from Miami, but at least is not another vaporwave design and it is not crowded with Spam like the one from my man Alonso. Good old OurLando, Florida. Would make a lot more sense for a race in Indy, but pretty cool Wearing a basketball helmet outside of a Football stadium is certainly a choice. how many guys gonna hit lando\\'s head like it was a ball That\\'s a nice football Ironically being held around the football stadium, nowhere near the Miami Heat or basketballs of any kind. kind of cool but kind of ugly lol Does the world think of Miami as a basketball town? Genuine question and kind of hilarious if so Why though? r/ATBGE And he answered super bowl instead of NBA finals clincher court side. It disturbs me how realistic this is. I\\'d hate going to touch it and it feeling smooth and hard, not bumpy with some give We gotta see Danny Ric’s but I think it’s safe to say Lando wins the helmet race It’s so cool… but it bothers me sooooooo much that the panels are wrong. Ball is life Can\\'t say I\\'m a fan of this one... \"Lando\\'s Helmet ? Max doesn\\'t need one. He just shaves his head bald and paints it to look like a football helmet. Checo one the other hand will put a helmet around his helmet because he\\'s scared. But Max isn\\'t. He doesn\\'t fear anyone or anything for that matter.\"\\n\\n\\\\-Helmut Marko (probably) I like the idea, but I dont like how it looks He\\'s gone from tennis ball to basket ball\\n\\nThis is unbelievably cool though, goddamn This has to be the sickest helmet design I’ve seen in a long time Ok this is actually one of my favourite helmet designs from him ever This is spot on! This is so cool lmaoo I don’t really like it, but it’s definitely very well done r/ATBGE (Aweful taste but great execution) I hope everyone on the grid calls him “Basketball Head” all weekend a la Hey Arnold Hot damn that\\'s a good lookin lid. It\\'s revolting. Well done! Didn\\'t he answer Superbowl over NBA finals in the would you rather video? That\\'s original..and pure.\\n\\nGood thing we can still have this kind of design for once without 5000 sponsors desecrating the design philosophy or someone complaining about his trypophobia or something. The ugliest helmet I\\'ve ever seen, kinda hilarious though. as an American i love that F1 drivers come to America just to fucking let loose and do all the goofy things Wow! Very nice!! Amazing Basketball sucks 5/7. Perfect score. my god it’s hideous Ew lmao Everything about this GP is cringeworthy. Ready to score a three pointer race. It triggers my trypophobia. I hate it. I like it. r/atbge Possibly the coolest and most original design I’ve seen! Will definitely stand out! Great job to the artist/designer The least aerodynamic helmet on the grid Shouldve saved the design for one of the mercedes or ferrari drivers. Can just imagine them bouncing up and down the straight lol I wanna dribble it this looks amazing r/ATBGE\\n\\nEDIT: Subbed in the wrong direction. Coming from the guy who doesn\\'t know what city the Lakers play for lmaoo FUGLY. I hate it. Lando Magic! ummm.... no horrible Epic And yet Gasly met MJ... Lame Why is the lamest sport in America invading F1? This is stupid….I said it *ducks*. \\n\\nLeast fav of the weekend. But concept is admittedly a little cool My eyes... Its at a football stadium WHAT Does it actually have the raised bumps? It looks like it with the way the light is reflecting on some of those pics! It looks like when you mess up the air bladder in the ball lol I’m not sure if I absolute hate or absolutely love this. It’s definitely one or the other Whole grid is going to have a special helmet at this point lol. 🏀 Bro no fucking way lmao I can feel it with my eyes I doubt this is why Lando went for this particular design, but the NBA playoffs are happening now and ESPN/ABC has a big chunk of the broadcast rights and they will be airing the race, so it works as a cross-promotion for Disney as well, which I’m sure they’ll mention and appreciate. Damn that’s astrometric!! that texturing tho…. That is fucking awesome! The detail is incredible. Blursed That looks really cool I think Looks like a real ball! Amazing Someone needs to put this on tradingpaints immediately Do you think he likes basketball? This is truly awful and I love it Le Mau this is actually disgusting but it\\'s done so well lmao Lewis and Charles should be wearing it, *boing boing boing* I had no clue they got helmets for specific grand prix. I just thought they used the same one New meaning for bouncing on the track... Bruh....... Noooo way Should have put the Miami Heat logo on it (LETS GO HEAT) Pretty sweet helmet, but let the porpoising begin! 😂 I read the first two words quickly, as Nandos. The colour of the helmet doesn’t help, nor the texture. I think maybe I should lay off the chicken for a while. I love Lando & this helmet is awesome but the child in me is hoping Danny Ric takes a marker & writes ‘END’ next to the giant bell logo on the back. kind of cool but kind of ugly lol Whoever painted it did a phenomenal job the texture looks so realistic All that work and money for him to DNF Interesting to not show the front lol My helmet has a sticker on it saying that I can\\'t paint it or add any stickers to it or it will no longer be effective. How TF did they do this? was it tested at all? Bruh All fun and games until instincts take over and Ricciardo tries to Dunk Lando\\'s head. He wins the Best Helmet Ever award. That\\'s one of the coolest helmet design I\\'ve ever seen. Suns in 4 Straight 🔥 This is awesome MOVE IT BASKETBALL HEAD! This is my favourite helmet ever. I like how they made it look bumby without it actually being bumby.\\nI wish it was bumpy though. @lerbonjanes u like what u see? Some people in the comments who don\\'t think this is cool... What is cool to you? I don’t understand how this relates to Miami. It’s not really a basketball city. The Miami Heat have had empty seats all throughout the playoffs… that\\'s fuckin rad That, as the kids say, is dope. Friking awesome! Move it football head! No Miami Heat logo? Is there any backstory of why it\\'s a basketball themed? Head like a fuckin orange. That\\'s beautiful My favorite helmet I’ve seen so far What\\'s that plastic thing on the back of the helmet for? Best helmet so far I love it! so cool Now this is next level [ Can’t believe it’s right in my backyard and can’t go :/ Drivers will do anything to get a signature from MJ... tbh I would do the same Heat culture baby. I mean that’s incredible This is just good moneysaving by McLaren. Recycle and reuse! Outfuckingstanding This is one of the most completely random helmet designs of all time and I\\'m here for it. It was designed by a guy called MDM Designs, you should check out their Facebook, he does quite a few drivers designs! Baller If it was a videogame helmet paintjob you could change - this would be the annoying one developers give everyone for free as an incentive to buy better ones for money.

So bad My brain hurts when I look at the rear right and front right. And there\\'s a palm tree on the sea.. oh wait it wasn\\'t a sea right.. still.. Nice looking poster.  Feel like this is what Alpha Tauri wanted theirs to be lol. I like the art style of it. Love the pre race posters the teams do. They are trying Everything is so bad with Merc this year Haas did it first and better Could someone better in Photoshop than me please add some dolphins jumping in the water?\\n\\nEdit: maybe also take out that monster palm tree out in the ocean. You can literally see how excited they are to drive the W13 from their faces. Russell has Frank Grimes energy.

Looks like a tintin special closest we\\'ll ever get to an Indian Grand Prix now I guess Damn, this one is really great! The better poster for Miami GP I was wondering why there\\'s an Indian flag(🇮🇳) there, then I saw the palm tree.\\n\\nNever knew that Miami has its own flag Bottas looks like Tintin Tintin! I scrolled past thinking that\\'s the Indian flag That\\'s a beautiful poster, they win this round Love the references to Miami Vice. Don Bottas :D At first I was thinking what the fuck does the Indian flag have to do with Miami Alfa aesthetic is just always on point! I dont understand the Indian Flag /s What is the other flag? Looking almost like the Indian National Flag. This just has a lovely vibe to it They put a drop shadow on \"GRAND PRIX\" but forgot it on \"MIAMI\" Tintin Goes to Miami Really thought that was the Indian flag for a second until I payed closer attention and looked up \"Miami flag\". All I can see with Bottas\\' outfit, is Robin Williams in The Birdcage Am I the only one who sees a TinTin style going on? With how much they want the track to be Monaco it\\'s pretty ironic that their flag is basically just India\\'s There you go. The real Kings of poster design shows the way once again. Enough of the Miami Vice inspired posters. Ugh. The roaring (20)20’s That’s raw What\\'s up with all the custom designed stuff for this race? It\\'s it because the track is new outer is this gonna happen every year? Thought this was Last Shadow Puppets fan art for a moment TinTin? It looks like Dale Gribble as Bottas Got Confused for a second thinking that was an incorrect representation of the Indian Flag. Google told me thats Miami city Flag Reminds me of the movie the birdcage lol \\n\\nIs that the couple from the birdcage? Is that Bobby Hill? This reminds me of the poster with the weird butt Why doesn’t this sub put as much effort into art with all the other tracks lol. Lovin it tho Classiest of them all What have they done to Bottas?! nice to see a poster styled from before the cocaine days People were hating on the alfa livery but it looks really good even when it\\'s not lined up. My favorite for shure Thought it was the Indian flag for a quick second Work by [Jalcalara]( Theyve done several Alfa posters previously in this gorgeous ligne claire style. Wtf? indian? fags? whata f....? Love this style! Very Tintin-esque! Buddh international autodrome Alfa Romeo designers don’t miss do they At least someone’s graphic designer is sticking to the non crypto design scheme Okay it is a comic in a country with a rich comic book history. Not an I the only one who thinks that the style is more Franco-Belgian comic than American?\\nI get strong Tintin vibes here.\\n\\nBut looks really nice. Such a beautiful poster, I wish Manor had managed to hold on, they always did good work Man, those clothes…I’m in Florida and this morning humidity at my house hit 90% and it’s 95 degrees outside right now. This is giving me some real Tintin vibes, I love it. Tintin\\'s adventure at the Miami Grand Prix. \\n\\nCredit! As a general rule ([see full rules]( a standalone Discussion post should:\\n\\n- be of interest to the sub in general, and not a specific userbase (e.g. new users, GP attendees, just yourself)\\n- be able to generate discussion (e.g. no yes/no or easily answerable questions)\\n- show reasonable input and effort from the OP\\n\\nIf not, be sure to [look for the Daily Discussion]( /r/formula1\\'s daily open question thread which is perfect for asking any and all questions about this sport.\\n\\nThank you for your cooperation and enjoy the discussion!\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/formula1) if you have any questions or concerns.* I don’t think people really appreciate how difficult producing a live event for television is when the “most important thing right now” is constantly unclear (in contrast to football or baseball or basketball where the ball is always the top priority) No offense, but this post kinda screams of “I don’t really know what I’m talking about but I’m going to tell people how to do it anyway”\\n\\nI don’t think “F1 producer” is a real job overarching job that involves the same people in-race and in this pre-event and creating the graphics. And for the intro event, I’m sure there were some time constraints in place that they had to adhere to. \\n\\nObviously you’re still free to have your opinion and some of your points are valid, but I think there’s a lot of confusion on what some of these people do and don’t do. The intro party was just that, an introduction. I\\'m not sure why you expected teams to be interviewed or anything like that. To be honest, they really should have just put the teams out without having them make a statement which would have made the whole thing cleaner. The only real issue I had with it was a clear lack of direction.  Seemed like Crofty had to steer the ship like an MC which was pretty weird for this kind of event. \\n\\nRace broadcast complaints are just silly, honestly. The races are live and the people broadcasting can only see so much from their angles. They don\\'t always know when there\\'s an on-track battle going on. When a decision is made to cut to replay or change angles, it\\'s generally too late to cut to something else. >I couldn’t enjoy it because they kept rushing everyone in and out making it VERY obvious that they were under very strict time restraints\\n\\nMy guess is the time restraints had to do with wanting a night-time vibe without having a late-night noise permit.\\n\\n>like Zak Brown which was the only American on the stage \\n\\n*Sad Otmar noises* I think the replays of the start have become such a thing because recent history has shown the race is won or lost on the start. Hopefully as the racing on track gets better and cars can now follow more closely and even pass, the broadcast will adapt to that and show less start replays. You can also replace F1 producers with Fans...\\n\\nFans sometimes don’t understand what the fans actually want and would benefit from the most.\\n\\nNot saying you are wrong, but fans make the stupidest requests most of the time. Quite odd how you portray your own personal opinion as \"what the fans want\". Youre not speaking for everyone else with these arguments so dont act like you are. I am a fan too and i prefer the broadcast to stay like it is. F1 should just let fans run everything. Im sure it would be great. What? You didn\\'t enjoy looking at Sainz blank stare instead of watching Leclerc rejoining the track after Norris last race? Not just the start replays, what drives me through the wall is the need to show the crowds reacting to a drivers battle over the actual action on track. I don\\'t want to watch the crowds and miss the action. I\\'m not asking for much. An opening ceremony or launch party for a race event is ridiculously over the top and why a lot of people were cringing when Vegas was announced. That’s going to be so much worse, a level of cheese on a grand scale. I can’t wait for Liberty to sell up, when they’ve milked the sport for all it’s worth Completely agree about ridiculous start replays when there are still opening lap battles going on. I can understand that mid-race sometimes the most interesting moment is missed, but it should still be done better as well. I think that live timing with laps and sectors should be either free or very inexpensive.  Data access is big for f1 fans who stick around. Finally, more wide shots rather than tracking cars from very close which removes the sensation of speed. It\\'s not a good look when amateur videos from smartphones provide better viewing than professional broadcast. Oh, and same goes for filtered, fly-buzzing car engine sound. Understanding a fans perspective and adhering to it is one area the sport really needs to learn in order to grow. The media that covers F1 is very entrenched in the sport, they have been around for decades. Because of this, often without realizing, I think they carry the exclusivity and elitism the sports history is entrenched with. F1, under its previous management viewed themselves as an elite, rich, prosperous group and marketed themselves to that select few. As the world has become more digital, there is a switch in where people go to get there sports coverage. Think barstool vs. espn. \\n\\nI think part of F1\\'s hesitancy in embracing this change is they very much like to control the narrative. I don\\'t know the solution because for them as an entity there are extreme benefits to being able to control the narrative or the story. You better get ready for 60% of the race to be fan crowd shots this weekend. Tv director has been shocking for a while imo Most over in r/indycar suggest Penske has been eyeing up an endurance race since he bought IMS. Could also just be a courtesy visit. I would love it if F1 came back to Indy. I attended a few races back in the early 2000’s when they were there, and would love to go back with my wife for a race (she’s only interested in F1, no other racing unfortunately). Is he Penske material? The scenes if the US gets a fourth race at Indy. The Anti-American squad gonna have to be on suicide watch. Before the comments flood in: F1 isn’t and has no reason to go to Indy. In 2020 penske said he was interested in f1 but that no serious talks were happening, this was back when a fia official went to see the indianapolis motor speedway facilities. I\\'m going to assume the same situation remains, neither penske nor f1 is interested, i guess penske is bussy with Indycar and there\\'s not that much money for f1 in indiana? Idk i for one would hope indy comes back eventually Why wouldn\\'t the head of the FIA go see the head of IndyCar and the most famous circuit in the US? Original Res Photos - [Photo](  [Photo 2](  [Photo 3]( COTA, indy and long beach would be the ideal 3 USA race calendar F1 Indy 500 just for the Lols Penske has little to no interest in hosting F1. He could literally be talking about anything. 4th US race in 2023 confirmed. “You like money?”\\n\\n“Fuck yeah” So he only sometimes wears a thawb? I went to the miami eprix years ago (formula e) and got grandstand seats.   Between the track and my grandstand were a line of trees, so i could briefly see the cars zip down the straight between the trees for maybe a quarter second.   I wound up leaving my more expensive seat and watching the race from the general admission area.   \\n\\n\\nKarun Chandhock spun right in front of me and maybe 15 feet apart we shared awkward eye contact. It\\'s the ability to Instagram it is what you\\'re paying for. Honestly $1000 is pretty cheap by Miami GP standards (considering cheapest grandstands were $800) so I’m not surprised. You are basically paying for the experience of being somewhere near an F1 car while getting a tan and drinking beer Brazil, living the dream\\n\\n$150 for 3 days\\n\\n$2.5 beer\\n\\n$2 beverages Ya but when are you ever going to feel the sand between your toes at an F1 race. 😂 You think they care? Hint, miami wasn\\'t chosen because of it\\'s die hard fans. You’re paying for social media clout, not to see the race Uh... you\\'d probably stand up for the actual race. Isn\\'t it hard to judge without a view that\\'s actually *from* the seats. Like they care. They are there for the sand, booze and bc they heard thats the place to be in \"Miami\" this wknd lol\\nIf you tell them the race is between the safety and medical car, they will believe it lol Just like the thousands of people who travel to Coachella just for vibes, you bet your ass that the people who forked out $1000 for these beach chairs aren’t gonna care much about the racing Who cares? Most people there dont even know how F1 works.  It\\'s all about famous and rich people getting that instagram post with some champagne, and networking. From what I remember there isn\\'t a tv in this area. The opposite side is surrounded by stands. I think they will have to watch it on a tv in the HardRock club It\\'s not about seeing the cars. It\\'s about being there and taking Instagram stories. If you sit at Rascas or on your yacht in Monaco you can\\'t see the cars very well either. It\\'s about showing off Hear the race live but watch it on TV from your beach chair still seems not bad. These people probably aren\\'t there to see the cars anyway Most of the people probably aren’t going there for the race anyway The most surprising part of this post to me, is that those seats are *only* $1000 F1 could have had this race at the Daytona or Homestead-Miami road course. God forbid people pay to actually watch a race and not just flex on the poors. Wait, there\\'s a race? Everything about consuming this race in person is a total shit show. \\n\\nIt leaves me concerned for the Vegas GP Am I the only one thinking there isn’t an actual safety Barrier for the beach side? Did they not think of elevating it? This is making the mistake of assuming the people who paid to be in this section are there for the race.\\n\\nAt this point I\\'m just going to stop bitching and embrace the suck. Wouldn\\'t they be able to just stand up and be basically trackside? I don\\'t understand all the hate Great planning lol. In Austria, general admission tickets for the whole weekend are 110€ and you can literally see  half the track from there There\\'s cars? Only in Miami lol I imagine they\\'ll be up against the fence. The people buying 1000 “beach” seats aren’t there to see the race. The race is just the back drop to this particular social event for them It\\'s not a place to see the race but *to be seen* at the race How will they not be able to see the car if the track is right beside them? Can\\'t they just ... stand up during the actual race? The prices for the race are ridiculous Those are being seen, not to actually see (the race).. My first race, 2000, bought GA seat, was 40 feet from the cars at 200MPH with perfect view. Oh yeah, ticket was $30!.. Ahh, the good ole days (cant believe i just said that) I\\'ve never felt the urge to go watch a GP live. Extreme cases like this aside, won\\'t you just get a better view of things at home? it\\'s not about the money it\\'s about sending a message Oh you think people whom book those seats are there to see the cars? But those insta photos, tho! 🤦 Why do people think anyone paying $1000+ for hospitality tickets are going to watch the race on the track?\\n\\nThey will watch it on a TV, at the bar. If they watch it at all. Circuit de Barcelona.\\n\\nGA ticket: £140. \\nReturn flight & hotel: £380 (5 night). \\n\\nYes please.  😎😎😎 I can sense some Fyre festival vibes for those seats 😂 Most people going to this event arnt there to see the cars Imagine paying $1000 and see a wall. But the people who pay $1000 for F1 probably don\\'t even car for the F1 they will be in the VIP area and drinking champagner and eating during the race anyway.\\n\\nWhile I am sitting at the track 24/7 Friday to Sunday in Spielberg with my <100€ ticket to see F3, F2 and Porsche and of course F1. This year it is over 100€ for the first time. lets hope thats real sand But you\\'re missing the point - everyone can see YOU 😎💰💸 Ive been to 3 races and you can barely see any cars at any track. Having lived in Miami for 4 years, I can say this whole track and event is the epitome of Miami\\n\\nFlashy, overpriced, (likely) sub par quality Welcome to Miami....they dont care about the race, it\\'s about showing off you paid for the seats. I live in Miami, it\\'s the most fake city I have ever seen, can\\'t wait to get back out. Games gone no. that would have to be risen for 2-3 meters. but for that, the safetyfence is to low. Thank God COTA is a proper race course There are multiple giant screens on track.  \\n\\n\\nLet\\'s be clear: The best way to view the actual GP is in front of your TV (or your PC if you are using F1 TV account).\\n\\nThis is an experience, you are next to F1 cars, there\\'s an electric mood, beer, food you name it. it\\'s redicolus. it\\'s a bad fake beach and it would be ears killer. I\\'m torn I want good racing because I will watching at home. But all this fake lifestyle in the middle of a parking lot is making me sick and I don\\'t want F1 returning and doing this all over again Looks like a good spot to nap and have a beer. Is this next to the fake water? That\\'ll complete the vibe. All these people will be watching the race on a giant screen somewhere nearby. The actual race is for ambiance. [deleted] Why would I want to seat on sand if there\\'s no beach?? Like, sand is the bad thing about going to the beach which is what people who can\\'t afford a swimming pool do. I thougt the yachts on fake water already didn\\'t make much sense but this is another level. HardRock sucks. This was a problem when Singapore hosted there first race So much better off booking a high rise room for the weekend and watching from there Miami GP taking inspiration from Fyre! I\\'m sure  things like this will get sorted for next year at least. They\\'re obviously a bit rushed this year This shit is turning into the new Fyre Festival. Its laughable. If it is this fake I can’t imagine what Vegas will be like How can you fuck up so badly lol Yeah not many people attending the Miami gp care about f1 That’s ok, the people buying those seats aren’t interested in the cars or racing anyway Man, as a new American F1 fan it really is a smack to the face. I don’t understand how F1 is expected to grow if they keep catering to a wealthier fanbase. Do I like more races coming to the US? Hell yeah! Do I like that two of them are now going to be in super tourist spots that the average Joe will struggle to afford? Hell no! Does F1 as an organization want to grow, or are they content with getting money from the rich? [deleted] As an American. I’m already hating this GP There is a second floor in the beachclub. If that cost more I don\\'t know Then again it\\'s not much to slag. Was at Imola and they really don\\'t do all they can either to ensure a good viewing experience.\\n\\nF1 should really work with all the tracks a but over the next years to try improve it Is the sand real at least Can’t you just walk around and go watch somewhere else like at football games? I always go to the fan zone party areas and watch from standing bar area. Nobody buying those seats cares what they’re able to see, only that they *will be seen*. Mrbeast new video place lmao the target customer are the celebs who barely give a fuck about the race anyway so it works out gonna sell out either way >most likely won\\'t be able to see cars\\n\\nOh they will when Carlos finds his way to the closest thing to gravel that this track has. Those seats are ment to be sold to influencers, not real racing fans. Those seats are to be seen in, not to see from. Something that caught my attention when Esfand the twitch streamer went to COTA was how many people didn\\'t come from racing, rather they came for the experience. Cool people, vibes, drinks and watch cars too. \\n\\nThis is just an extension of at-track experience trying to attract that audience. This is how influencer based marketing works, see revolve fest Coachella for example. Are we remotely surprised? The race organizers only care how it looks on tv. Same with the people sitting there. They just want to be seen there. You’re paying to share a space with beautiful rich people. Good deal I suppose if you want followers. They have places like this in Montreal too. It’s not a Miami or US thing. It’s all $$$ and that’s fine. Let those people enjoy that experience.\\n\\nI will say being on track level and close is pretty cool too. It’s just a different way to experience the show. Is the sand even real? That’s why I always go in the back I know Indy is considered low brow and all, but for $1,000 I am taking my father to Indy 500 and sitting with a great view of the final turn and start/finish. You could also toss in the hotel and rental car for Friday-Monday, and one of our fight tickets from Minneapolis in that $1,000.00. I really hope it rains lol\\n\\nBring on the chaos Isn’t there a whole beech club?  They can prolly watch from that deck I can’t wait for a rain to down pour on these seats…. Are the races in Europe this ridiculously expensive? That track and its design around it is pure chaos. Cool spot, but unless you’re on a high pedestal you’ll won’t be able to see shit. Looks like they’ll see plenty. And moreso than that, they look like what’s on show for the grandstands when there’s no action I. Those corners.\\n\\nThat would be so awkward to me to have thousands looking across at a few dozen in those beach chairs lol The F1 snobbery on here is something else. \\n\\nIf these seats are advertised as an \"up close and personal F1 experience\" and you can\\'t see shit then that is bullshit, don\\'t assume it is just women with fake breasts here for a holiday and an Instagram photo. \\n\\nI would pay a premium for beach seats where I could watch the race with a good site line. If that is what these people were expecting then this is really shitty for them and you all shouldn\\'t be a bunch of cunts. What am I missing? Why won’t they be able to see over that wall? This GP is a becoming a failure before it even starts. I can see it now, the youtube mini documentaries about the nightmare Miami GP of 2022. Fuuuuuck Miami They are there to be seen, not to see the race. Looks like they\\'ll be able to see just fine? People there don\\'t watch the race anyway they just want to be seen I wouldn\\'t worry about it, the people that are going to spend tens of thousands for those stupid seats probably won\\'t be able to tell you who Michael Schumacher or Ayrton Senna were either.\\n\\nMaybe they\\'ll remember Nicky Louder from that movie Thor was in.  They\\'ll be looking at their phones all race anyway. They will taste and see sand ;) its crazy how they\\'re in Miami but those dumbasses couldnt get the race right next to the water.  Meanwhile we have races in Monaco.  So really, was F1 just being cheap for MIA? Lol. would\\'ve been a cool opportunity to have cameras on the track-side barriers feeding to screens immediately behind - crudely making an \"invisible wall\". I can go to Mid-Ohio and see the Indy race for like $60. The Miami race has just lost the plot. Americans love overpriced sub par quality  let them have it in peace Better bring your own hyraulic ramp to see over the fence. xD You can feel the speed!! Duh Bold of you to assume they care I get free tickets from some guy I know for the red bull ring every year. He sponsors something or whatever. No idea. So many people are making out everybody who bought these tickets are there for social media likes. People can be richer than average Joe and still have just a big of interest in F1 as average Joe. It could be that they’re taking their partners are are keeping all parties happy? It could just be that they like the idea of this. Let people enjoy what they enjoy… Really cool, I like it. I feel like Zhou ended up being the perfect #2 driver for Alfa. He has a very similar demeanor to Bottas. A bit quiet but seemingly a happy guy. Keeping his head down and just have great drives for his first season. I keep putting money on him to get in the points. Siiick! Really starting to like zhou tbh That’s a nice helmet. Wow I love this.  Danny Ric vibes This is the one. Starting to really like this kid. Seems like he might have potential. \\n\\nCool helmet too Like it alot. Cool helmet, good dude. It has probably been said somewhere, but why do all (?) drivers have a special Miami livery? \\n\\nCommercially interesting of course and it really looks like they were heavily influenced by a kind of blueprint of palm trees and happiness. Everybody get up it\\'s time to slam now 🎶 my man included more basketball references than sponsor logos lol Why does he have a busted knock off bugs bunny cartoon? Is it a logo in not familiar with? That is one fucking sick lid, man. Gaat damn! That is really a slick design, vibrant and really pops out at you Aside from the playoffs being in full swing anyone know the deal with both Lando and Zhou having basketball features? Dope ! RIP Kobe. What a great helmet design Zhou: \"Hey, can I put Lola Bunny on my helmet?\"\\n\\nAlfa: \"We have Lola Bunny at home\"\\n\\nThe Lola Bunny at home: They all kinda look the same Such a cool helmet and I\\'m liking the basketball rabbit adding a nice cool touch. Soo good! The colors pop so well! And the sponsor logos aren\\'t overbearing. 🔥🔥 A Lisa Frank binder with stickers, F1 Helmet Edition. Does he sell them on scale? Can someone tell me how he\\'s holding the helmet on the first pic? Is this guy a magician? This is fucking sick!! Sweet design! He actually put his Fursona on it. The fucking mad lad Guys I think he likes basketball Love the space jam reference! I like the “totally not basketball Bugs Bunny from space jam due to international copyright law” on the side, nice touch. How do I get a useable replica of this? What does the Chinese word mean on the basketball part? Very cool. Maybe a bit cluttered but it\\'s a lovely departure from the typical racing helmet designs. All this Miami stuff is going to severely damage my wallet With little dipshit and daddy gone Haas seems like an entertaining and marketable team.\\n\\nThis is great news. The idea is not ludicrous, the company appears to have stability. A 50 million or so marketing deal may bot be that outside their expansion plans and budgets. \\n\\n\\n5his is definetly not a rich energy situation The KMAG effect. \\n\\nLooking into their company, sounds like a pretty solid sponsorship. Probably not gonna be life changing for Haas based on the size, but who gives a fuck. Glad to see Haas getting some new sponsorship. Haas going to the moon! With a name like Lunar I was so worried this was another crypto sponsorship. Thankfully it\\'s an actual bank that provides actual products and services. I’m sure this will work out. So much positivity surrounding Haas at the moment. Adding to that they have a very respectable package this year, getting new sponsors on bord must have become a million times easier. Huh? They had their logo on the car at previous weekends already, why they announce it just now? Will it also be on F1TV? With the announcement on sky, I was hoping something in the US would pop up. I’ll watch! >ESPN will broadcast live coverage of all qualifying and race sessions across their portfolio of channels, including ESPN2, ESPN3, ESPNU and ESPNEWS.\\n\\nVery surprised ESPN is actually putting W series on their flagship stations. My initial reaction was \"ok sure they\\'ll just throw it on ESPN+ and make people pay to stream it\" Nice, I\\'ve always wanted to be able to watch W Series here. I\\'m in too.  Good job Some great broadcasting deals for the W series lately Looks like more Magisterial Messi replays on BeIn! Great news. Excited to watch. The only thing I see on the ESPN app right now is the Spanish language broadcast. Hope they just haven’t gotten that squared away yet. This is great news! Anyone from this group have a good shot at F1? Fuck yes thank you. Anything to support these women Yay! I can’t for the life of me understand why F1 can’t seem to work it out for it to be on F1TV… seems a bit of a no-brainer. Are there pictures of the cocaine chicane ? Look at all the shadows on the road. The surface doesn’t look flat at all. Can’t wait to see HAM bobblehead makes an appearance on the main straight. Curious as to why they have the last few starting boxes at an angle. Wouldn\\'t it be easier and more fair if these were straight? Or is there a required distance between the track edge and the grid box for crews to work ad such? Hold up - I work for one of these companies and haven\\'t been offered hospitality tickets. Resignation incoming. It seems so strange to associate AutoNation and Gainbridge with F1 and not Indycar.\\n\\nAside from that, I\\'ve been curious all year to see what Michael Schumacher\\'s cruise line is like. This is probably the first time since... the 70s or something, that a Grand Prix has these many partners on the same track, at the same time. We gotta bet on which barrier sponsors will Latifi hit first Space in Sector 3 for Reddit.  Not too late! So... no zoom zoom zoom this weekend? :c I like this. It means no part of the track looks similar, so it\\'s easy to tell where the drivers are. Rear will snap into Pirelli barriers. If the promoters got their way it would be _\"Lewis Hamilton is going through the Heineken 0.0 corner presented by GEICO. Get the best insurance in the whole country\"_ Glad to see Mick sponsoring a part of the track There needs to be a Carvana sponsorship boarding. That’s where Latifi will crash, carrying on for Jimmie Johnson I am surprised by an extent to which this community embraces sponsors. You guys are genuinely excited about them and their ads. I find it surprising, because personally I despise every kind of advertising that is shoved down my throat, and I actively block it from my consciousness. Like, I do not acknowledge who the sponsor of given team or event is, and you won\\'t make me. I am baffled by the fact that so many people have directly opposite point of view on this. Why do you care? What about the space between Gainbridge and Aramco? I’m still not convinced Gainbridge is a real company. Every track has a sponsor on every wall and corner but we have to complain this week because “AMERICA BAD” huh? Ok Fuck Crypto.com I’d rather see a Wells Fargo ad It\\'s like neoliberalism had a bender a threw up a F1 race track. How is this shit content This is the most american thing ive ever seen in F1 These are the things that worry me about F1 in America, everything is going to be sponsored. Was not expecting to see my former employer here. Will be a good way to see where the drivers are, though! Why is there a non-alcoholic? Are we in Saudi Arabia or what? Gainbridge eh? Hmm So mow we get 17 unnecessary pop up adverts each lap 😂🤣😂 Is it me or do more indycar sponsors have placement here than cota? How much more expensive is cota brand placement in comparison to miami crypto.com will drop billions on some cool shit for fun and mfs will still willingly use their service. Like you are being robbed by millennials rn lmao i cant wait for this race My f1 team on f1 manager(1996) after I start getting sponsors Still don’t understand why MSC cruises haven’t tied up Mick. It’s a natural fit. Surely this is detrimental to the sponsors themselves? When there\\'s a million different sponsors around the track they get drowned out individually *Ricciardo showed up at last year’s race dressed as a cowboy and did pre-show donuts in a vintage Chevrolet stock car. Later in the weekend, COTA hosted the world Spam-eating championship*\\n\\nHow to get Americans to care aye? American, here for the comments 🍿 *\"The posh, stodgy European sport...\"*\\n\\nWhen your editor tells you to add in some British sounding adjectives... Just wanted to say, Very well written article. For those who plan to read it NASCAR once tried to get a certain fanbase interested in their sport, it worked but to the cost of all the die hard fans who felt betrayed on the sport that had left them.\\n\\nThat certain fanbase then left and NASCAR was without many of its die hard audience and without the audience it tried to get.\\n\\nI worry that this is the way F1 is going now and in 10 or 20 years it will have been super popular and then drop off the radar. we\\'ll care for a minute. not longer. watch. Who knew all they had to do was increase ticket prices to 1.200 plus dollars? F1 needs to give some of us older American fans credit for having to explain what F1 was to people for so long 😩 *Anxiously awaits read out of stereotypes of an otherwise diverse, socially and culturally-rich, OECD, non-authoritatian nation of nearly 330M people* By creating fake drama? I don’t understand why all these websites keep claiming that f1 ‘has cracked’ the USA. There is on average 1 million viewers per race. For a country with over 300 million people this isn’t that much \"Americans need a driver for the popularity to rise even further \\'. I understand why but its funny . Following a driver because you share the same nationality not his skills or character God I hope America doesn\\'t start rubbing off on F1, but I fear it already has.... F1 was, is and likely will be European centric sport just like IndyCar, NASCAR, NBA and other US based series. Teams have factories there, karting is better there as well. Despite Liberty push for the US, F1 still has more fans in Europe despite gaining tracks in America (2 more in Miami and Las Vegas). Neither European fans come to for example Indy and say that change to look more European. I really hate articles like this because it makes me fight the urge to defend myself with \"Not ALL of us are like this\" commentary, but reading those comments are often equally as exhausting. \\n\\nI do think there is a disassociation between the average American consumer and what is being marketed to us. We are extremely aware of how on the nose the strategies are to reach us as the target audience, and at least for the people I know we\\'re all typically just as embarrassed by the lack of nuance. What are we to do? I\\'m not going to NOT watch a race just because it\\'s got this ridiculous pandering, but at the same time F1 will look at a successful event and go \"See! All this stuff we did is what the Americans wanted!\" WWE style contrived title battles and results? \\n\\nNot worth it. Thought it was a decent analysis of the American marketing machine churning right now around the Miami GP regardless of personal feelings re: Americanization of the sport/media around it. Can’t wait for all races to be hosted in Middle East and America Did they put guns on the cars? Just like everything else, they had to dumb it down for them to understand. Bless their hearts.. 😆 “Why do the LA Clippers trade for $2 billion? The NBA is a great sport, but it doesn’t have a global reach, and the Clippers don’t have 20 world championships to its name. So why are they worth four times McLaren?” - Zak Brown\\n\\nHe has a very good point. Benchmarking F1 teams against US sports team is just the first step, they ought to compare themselves to Premier League football teams one day, if not being the benchmark themselves for other global sports. I mean, F1 races are exclusively international in its reach (read: \"world\" championship), F1 pride itself as elite and glamorous (so why sell themselves cheap?), the advanced tech involved and amount of employees each team employs are mind-numbingly high (and they\\'re highly skilled to boot). The sky\\'s the limit. As an east coast American the best part of F1 are the 9am Sunday morning start times. Wake up, get some breakfast, watch the race and then it’s over by lunch and have the whole day left. I actually don’t like races in America for that exact same reason That is truly an AWESOME helmet design, Alonso has really nailed the use of the blue and the pink so perfectly! Gorgeous Why the fuck couldnt BWT let them have this pink on their livery? Looks waaaayy better than their bland shitty version of pink The car should have used this 2 tones of pink and blue.\\n\\nDamned corporate colors. Such a cool helemt.. and then there\\'s all the BWT crap all over it. I\\'m starting to hate this company. I like Very cool helmet. Nailed it with the palm trees and the lifeguard stations. It’s Miami. You gotta’ have ‘em. \\n\\nThe most authentic touch however is that green circle on the back. It’s a reference to the very rare “green flash” phenomenon that you *might* be able to see from the deep Keys when the sun can be seen setting into the ocean. That is brilliant! Brilliant! Love it [Some other angles]( Miami = pink I like 10/10 but where is KIMOA best helmet of the weekend BWT is comedy. The publicity must work for them\\nHowever. \\n\\nNot that I noticed. Skipped over their water filtration for the upcoming home build. Probably because I’m so tired of seeing their pink everywhere I can’t honestly believe I’m saying this, as I love Miami vice colors so much. But damn, I’m tired of seeing it already - helmets, posters, everything (shout out alpha for their poster tho) Very cool design Hot shit The blue and pink combination we wanted but didn\\'t get on alpine... So this is where Alpine\\'s v a p o r w a v e aesthetic is Holy fuck. Now *that* is vaporwave Alpine.

What the fuck, I\\'ve never seen Geo-blocked videos on Twitter before. G fucking G Sky Sports. lol, that accent is just as foreign to Miami as his Aussie accent Years later and Danny still qualifies behind Valtteri. Absolutely love it! A little known fact is that every Aussie gets Honorary American status if they want it. I hope we get a focused, trying to beat his teammate Daniel this weekend. The least funny driver on the grid. Most australians don\\'t even see him as one of us anymore anyway. They can have him. Honestly, I don\\'t. I find it super annoying. You mean the best photo of your life according to crofty? Opening party? What else does a race weekend consist of that I have no idea? I hate that I cut off Seb in this pic, he’s always been my favorite! I also got some good shots of Lewis, George and Charles but I don’t have an Imgur account and I don’t wanna spam the sub with posts! These guys full-on looking like the hottest new boys band; the New Kids on the Grid Look how happy they are!! Love to see it 4 wdc in one picture. Get yourself a man that looks at you like Zak does at Lando. Everyone on that photo looks genuinely happy to be there…good call from F1 to race in Miami (Gardens)… Christian still loves Seb Were cameras allowed for non-journalists or was it phone-cams only? enjoy the show AND the race on sunday USA. greets from an austrian F1 fan... as on every race sunday my friends and i will watch from my place on sunday evening (our timezone). A whole episode about how Lando hates Daniel so much he wouldn’t even let him stand with the team at the opening party is coming Big dad energy from Christian and zak..look at the way zak looks at lando and Christian looks at seb. \\n\\nLike the proudest dads out there. Poor Kev at the back lol Great pic! Hope you enjoyed the party! The livestream\\'s posted on F1\\'s official YouTube channel if anyone\\'s interested in checking it out. Why did they need rush the intros, was the music talent on some crazy contract to perform precisely at a certain time? Kevin peeking from the BG Mick seems to gravitate towards Seb. Let\\'s be real, everyone was just there to see Latifi. The fact that you got a glimpse of the goat is the reason it’s a great pic If they are all there already its kinda strange not doing the official media on the thursday.. nice pics What’s up with Ricciardos shirt? Does he wear one size bigger? I was way too focused on it when watching the opening party last night. Landos polo fits him just fine it looks like. Carlos looks very relieved that the sand is outside the track this time Kmag Podium Confirmed.  Look at him scheming, plotting. Dang, Latifi looks like he has a huge head in this shot. I watched it on YouTube and there were only a few fans relatively speaking probably less than 1k, you can tell the production was trying to show as little of the crowd as possible. Zhou joining mcclaren confirmed /s I scrolled thru ur post history & that realistic bat-boy post is abnormal So, what’s the over / under on the number of drivers who test positive for Covid next week?

[Original Res Photo](\\n\\nWell this is odd LOL Only Bloomberg would think that ridiculously expensive entry prices are something worth celebrating. The article is actually a very good read. BB does quality journalism \"How did they do it?\" \\n\\n\"Netflix\" Actually a really solid article Really great article. If you don\\'t want to read it more highlights the differences between how Bernie approached F1 vs. how Liberty approaches managing the sport. Netflix was a shot in the arm but if there was no F1TV or social media presence the sport really wouldn\\'t be as popular as it is now. DTS made it more approachable but Liberty\\'s management has made it consumable. Love the dig on NASCAR lmao. Looking like a Nintendo Power cover from the 90\\'s. Ferrari about to add caltrop compartments to their rear end That drawing doesn’t show any difference between old and new airflow. It only points out where the change happened. Am I missing smth? SMH man i just want carlos to finish the race. As someone who is a total F1 noob and new to the sport, it blows my mind that that little of a change can be the deciding performance factor of who potentially wins Yes. Tighter fights is all we need. Hope Mercedes solve their issues faster so that there will be a three way fight. I hope Mercedes upgrades work as well. It would be awesome to see 3-way battle between all 3 top teams. Always mildly amusing to me that they are doing over 300km/h whilst seated as if they\\'re in a  lounge chair. Original Res Photos - [Photo](  [Photo 2](  [Photo 3]( I know it’s been designed safely but man it looks fucking terrifying that the fuel is directly behind the driver like that. This is actually a drawing of Kimi. You can easily tell by the lack of drink in the cockpit. One of the best follows on F1 twitter.  Have learned a lot from his posts. I\\'ll be really disappointed if there\\'s no cocks... Damn that seating position gives a whole different perspective. This explains the Bottass, all the blood congregates in drivers’ posteriors It really shows how tightly packed they are in there with all the seating and padding around them and also see the roll over area that the halo and the rollover hoop create What\\'s the FIA safety camera used for? Is there any footage available?\\n\\nI mean, yeah for safety obviously, but in which circumstances for example? The seat is lighter than I would have expected. Probably no padding either. people don’t realise the amount of core strength required to be sat in this position for 2 hours with the performance of those cars. go try and sit in this position yourself for a small insight No pee bags? ಠ_ಠ And a driver…no arrows point to a driver 😂 Don\\'t some teams have their drinking system in the nose? forgot the steering wheel... *Mercedes logging on to watch this* Explained again Buchan Sport strikes again in his running series about 2022 floor concepts.  \\n\\nI don’t get why this post is so unpopular. The video tries to explain a working theory, which is does rather eloquently.\\n\\nB Sport is still hypothesizing, but as a very fresh ex-F1 aerodynamicist his musings are a lot more informed and interesting to watch than most youtube channels regarding the technical side of F1 this year. Good theories. This just looks like circuit specific upgrade.\\n\\nWe will know if they brought any upgrades to mitigate porpoising tomorrow (when they have to detail the upgrades for the show and tell) At Mercedes they are convinced that they have found the keys to the lack of competitiveness of the W13 and are working hard to try to revive the fortunes of the World Constructors\\' champion team. Brackley\\'s team was sure they had a car with extreme aerodynamics that should have given them a one second advantage per lap.\\n\\nThe facts have shown that this was not the case and, on the contrary, Lewis Hamilton and George Russell found themselves as the third force with a Silver Arrow that pays a gap of six to seven tenths per lap from Red Bull and Ferrari.\\n\\nFor the Mercedes technicians, the main difficulties derive from the exaggerated frequency of porpoising that brings the nefarious hopping almost all the way into the corners, while on the Ferrari it runs out much earlier as the top speeds drop.\\n\\nWhile we wait to see what Mike Elliott\\'s engineers have prepared for the fifth seasonal event (there\\'s a weight reduction of about 3 kg), we have to observe the front wing of the W13, which was designed for the Miami straights almost 2 kilometers long.\\n\\nThe image of Giorgio Piola taken in the paddock highlights how the adjustable flap has been redesigned to reduce drag: in particular, the incidence in the portion that goes from the nose to the support brackets has been reduced, while the trailing edge it has been reshaped with clearly visible material removals that make the profile very shaped. It\\'s around one tenth of a second if I am not mistaking, right? Hopium incoming I said it yesterday, but I hope Mercedes can challenge at the front this season. Not because I want them to win another championship, but because having three teams compete at the top is better than two. If Alpine and McLaren or any other team can also get to the top, that\\'d be awesome as well, but it seems like Mercedes is the closest as it stands. 3kg equates to about a tenth a lap. Given the margins of the midfield group that\\'s quite helpful.\\n\\nFor context a tenth would have seen George move up one in Bahrain. Lewis into at least Q2 and George up one again in Saudi. No change in Australia but Lewis would have been a fraction behind Norris. Nothing would change in Imola thanks to changing conditions and non-completed laps in red flags.\\n\\nObviously this can be negated by other teams losing weight, but it will make a difference in isolation. Nevermind the porpoising. Hopium for myself 3 kg?!!!!! \\n\\nThe whole team slaves away to shave off every last bit of weight, meanwhile the guys on the front wing are like, ‘our bad - we thought we needed a sack of spuds in there.’ But they still have the porpoise which is gonna hurt them alot this weekend #They\\'ve taken the sandbags off boys! It\\'s happening!!! Mercedes 1-2 incoming. Wings are actually the same it\\'s the adjusters on the end that are smaller Haha sandbags 3kg weight reduction is insane, considering front wing only weight about 10kg. I don’t quite believe this, cuz some says Mercedes was just 1kg over the 798kg minimum weight. Although they make this 3kg reduction, they still need to adding 2kg somewhere else. This may change the weight balance of whole car, which may give a little bit advantage I guess Can’t wait until this somehow makes the car worse. Finally can get ahead of Gasly or can he? Lets hope they get knocked out in Q1 again like in Jeddah 👌 This is the same wing from AUS seems to me? That\\'s a decent amount of weight to drop. Although if the porpoising situation is not improved by this then it\\'s not really going to change much :( new floor too? At first I thought you meant they had unloaded aero which would actually probably help with porpoising Taking 3kg off the very front end must do a ton to help with understeer, but I\\'d be worried about even more oversteer out of the corners. I was expecting to also see a very heavy zippo in this photo… Miami has so many slow bumpy corners, the porpoising will cripple them this weekend What are they going to light up with a 3kg lighter? A lap around this circuit seems fun I dont care what anyone says, this track layout has a good mix of nearly everything you want in a track.\\n\\n- Tricky apex turns (5,8,16)\\n- Straights long enough to pass on\\n- Heavy braking zones at the end of the straights\\n- Tight technical sections that may not be good for overtakes but punishes mistakes.\\n\\nThe only thing it lacks is elevation changes. No porpoising. This game is literally unplayable. SMH.\\n\\nAlso, that off-center Shell logo on the Ferrari halo looks odd. I know it\\'s because they can\\'t show alcohol advertising, so they removed the logo on the other side. But it would look better if they centered the Shell logo. Love the turn complex under the overpass. A little up, a little down, a little wiggle. I bet we’ll see big time gaps there, seems ripe for little errors. I didn\\'t buy F1 2021 because I knew it would be the exact same game as the 2019 and 2020 version. I hoped the 22\\' game would be a brand new game with new physics, graphics, game engine and hopefully new netcode for multiplayer, but this looks like a freaking reshade of 2021 again ffs The circuit looks awesome. Seems quite long, but very well done. We\\'ve heard the Mercedes and Honda engines in the game, time for Ferrari Not abusing the kerbs, this is not charles Is it me, or does the marina have real water in the game? It\\'s like a mix of Sepang, Baku, and Singapore. I mean it is Charles, it has to be hot. Right? This circuit is perfect for the redbull i expect another 1-2 You mean DLC from F1 2017 for price of 80 Euros, got it. \\nGarbage. That area under the bridge looks so clunky and ripe for a big crash, Love the turn complex under the overpass. A little up, a little down, a little wiggle. I bet we’ll see big time gaps there, seems ripe for little errors. Probably an extremely stupid question on my part, but will they actually develop different car models for the vastly differing cars on this year’s field instead of just the same generic show car with mildly incorrect liveries each time? How hard is it to get new engine sounds? I don\\'t understand. There are so many engine sound mods on racedepartment for other games made by people, and a whole game just keeps the same engine sounds for 2-3 years. I fucking hate codemasters Aw damn, it\\'s just a re-painted showcar. This livery seems like it would look amazing on an AT03 While teams are scraping liveries off, Alpha tauri is recycling that paint because you know, environment Oh an art car, that would be so cool to see them use it for the race! Direct link to Video [here (HQ)]( Possibly a one off livery It\\'s gonna be another NFT by Mr Gasly Brand new factory and Windtunnel in 2024, Audi will be very happy. Rather that than them taking over McLaren. **Aston Martin-Audi, Stroll admits discussions - News**\\n\\n**ASTON MARTIN-AUDI, STROLL ADMITS DISCUSSIONS**\\n\\n**Lawrence Stroll has confirmed that he has spoken with Audi, which is interested in taking over the F1 business, and said he is very happy with the collaboration with Mercedes**\\n\\nFabiano Polimeni\\n\\n20 hours ago\\n\\nThe presentation of financial results during the first quarter of the year coincided with the announcement of Aston Martin\\'s new CEO. Amedeo Felisa replaces Tobias Moers and, together with another former Ferrari - Roberto Fedeli, head of the technical department since June - will have to lead Lawrence Stroll\\'s brand towards the growth and development phase in the electrification era.\\n\\nThe conference call with investors, however, served not only to present the Q1 results but also to comment on the rumors - very solid - of an Aston Martin approached by Audi.\\n\\n**AUDI IN FORMULA 1 WITH ITS OWN TEAM**\\n\\nThe scenario is that of the German brand\\'s entry into Formula 1, from 2026. They are working on several solutions, where the way in the case of Porsche is better defined and looks at the collaboration with Red Bull.\\n\\nThe track that led to the acquisition of McLaren by Audi seems to have cooled, at the same time increased the odds on a possible purchase of the Aston Martin team, along with rumors that also look in the direction of Williams Racing and others to Sauber Motorsport.\\n\\n**STROLL CONFIRMS RUMORS**\\n\\nLawrence Stroll confirmed the discussions he had with Audi, in a brief statement in response to Bank of America explained: \"If we have been approached by Audi? yes. Are we very happy with our collaboration with Mercedes? yes. The world of Formula 1 is full of these stories.\"\\n\\nThe collaboration with Mercedes-AMG is very close under the industrial profile and an Audi entry in Formula 1 from the Aston Martin door would be configured with its own team, to take over structures and registration - as well as benefits of the Pact of Concord - Aston. Stroll has launched an important investment plan, called, however, to produce results that, so far, have been absolutely disappointing in the commitment of the team in Formula 1.\\n\\nStroll\\'s declarations have been understated, admitting discussions with Audi and, obviously, supporting the technical collaboration with the power unit supplier, Mercedes.\\n\\nCould it be the bells of an attractive offer from Audi to convince Stroll to leave the scene in Formula 1?\\n\\nIn taking over (and saving) Aston Martin in 2020, Formula 1 has been identified by the Canadian businessman as a key showcase for building a recognized global brand and player in the luxury performance sector. I remember a Beyond the Grid, can\\'t remember who, where they made the point that establishing a truly new team is a *bastard*. None of the good folk want to work for you - it could last three years and be a disaster. Rather than facilities, 90% of the value of F1 teams is the people. \\n\\nSo I think Audi will be better off paying through the nose for something like Sauber. Sounds like the best option for Audi. Aston Martin is based in the UK and build a completely new facility. Would be great to see a seat open up again Honestly the team was performing better under VJM. Micromanagement is killing this team. I rather prefer the full take over OMG, Vettel\\'s 5th WDC in an Audi?!?!?! As long as it isn’t McLaren Please, at least have it be a full on takeover then. I can\\'t stand daddy Stroll, much less when he might actually win. \\n“Have we been approached by Audi? Yes. Are we very happy with our collaboration with Mercedes? Yes. The world of Formula 1 is full of these stories.”\\n\\n\\nThis is what he actually said, you guys want stroll gone so badly you believe Every headline Bye Bye Daddy Stroll, don\\'t forget to take Lance or let the door hit you on the way out. This is great news! The sooner the Strolls are out of F1, the better for all. This guy is looking for someone who can solve the team\\'s technical problems with him constantly looking over their shoulders. Total micromanaging piece of shit That would be great, we could see a full german team in mick, seb or nico if they went full german in the marketing How does this work with the Mercedes ties Aston Martin has? How does this work commercially? There\\'s bound to be some overlap between their road car markets.. This would make way more sense than McLaren.\\n\\nFor one thing McLaren has \\'complex\\' ownership. They\\'ve sold off or licensed out so many parts of the business that trying to buy all of that back to absorb the brand would be a massive headache.\\n\\nGiven the amount of money being pumped into Aston Martin (both as an F1 team and car manufacturer) a lot of the world Audi would need to do is already in place, combined with a team thats historically pretty damn good at saving a few quid. If my understanding is correct, what that\\'s doing is basically prevent car from going any lower then it should? I think Ted discussed this (briefly) in the notebook. \\n\\nIt\\'s interesting because largely speaking you\\'re better off with \\'packages\\' of upgrades in 2022 because it\\'s more efficient use of resources...*unless* it\\'s something like this which unlocks what the car is really meant to be doing and is actually a very small upgrade.\\n\\nIf you think of the 2005 McLaren, a very small tweak unleashed the car.\\n\\nI think where folk are getting confused is the idea that Merc\\'s problems are the latter. If my understanding is correct, what that\\'s doing is basically prevent car from going any lower then it should? Finally Merc can fix it\\'s porpoising? This is why I love f1 and the precision engineering that comes with it. It just looks like a few slots of carbon fiber but the change can either put you near the front or be lapped several times. Driver61 video that explains this  When we first saw porpoising in pre-season testing, the trivial \"fixes\" people were commenting about included this one. Active suspension, bumpers/skates, etc. I believe there were even specific comments from either Braun, a team principal, or aero SME iirc saying that those would not fix the issue.\\n\\nIt seems like we just had a definitive article like this saying it was actually the rear suspension, so it just feels like this is ongoing click-bait to further leverage this topic to drive traffic. So my idea of a zero height floor actually kind of was right and could work, just not the whole floor obviously Ferrari will bring this upgrade this race let’s see if this may help Last year i had a game with my family where everyone was given 2 drivers at random and points were awarded by track positions gained/lost.\\nAt first it got very hectic but started getting interesting once everyone started getting engine penalties.\\nAlso it was a rollercoaster of emotions wishing for your favorite driver to start low on the grid to give you lots of possible points but at the same time wanting to have your favorite driver start high up in the grid because you want to see them in the podium. Would it be possible for you to share the Sheets link? I’ve been maintaining a Google Sheet of my own to classify the race results and the standings, just for fun And I’m pretty sure I’ve done a lot of unnecessary work to make it since I’m not too good with Sheets/Excel. Would love to take a look at yours That’s pretty cool, makes it a lot more fun, thanks for sharing.\\n\\nAny chance you share the templates if we wanted to replicate?

This pit entry, with the possibility of a classic Florida flash flood thunderstorms mid race... someone could easily end their race there, and if multiple people are pitting at once it can cause proper carnage That reminds me of the Le Mans Pit Entry Chicane in a way, it will test the drivers no doubt to see who can master this tricky chicane We\\'ve seen crashes at or in pit entry before. I\\'d be intrigued to see if we get that here. Since when is Latifi called “somebody” No gravel trap so Hamilton is safe Everyone staring at Latifi be like 👀 Who will cut it the most I don\\'t like these long time loss pitlanes. Since the speed limit reduction 2 stops have been so difficult so we end up with 1 stop and lots of tyre saving. The drivers are lucky that it will be dry. slow button on What happens if you cut the track in the pitlane? Penalty? Well it has tarmac when you miss the entry of the chicane so where is the problem Just because we\\'re in America doesn\\'t mean we suddenly have to stop putting turns on our racetracks. Latifi is going to make 1 fanbase extremely happy and another extremely upset then it seems *cough*  Latifi *cough* [deleted] China 2007 is without a doubt in my top 10 F1 moments of all time along with Senna crashing Prost out at Suzuka in 1990, and all the Bose headphones that died last year whenever Toto didn\\'t get his way. \"Should be long enough for people to forget about Daniel Abt, yeah?\" Noice.       \\nBack up to a full 12 team grid.

Peroni bottle is too dull, and looks faceted, which it isn\\'t. Overly saturated magenta orb behind the car is slightly overpowering, doesn\\'t quite match her lip colour.

She reminds me of Flo from Progressive. Is that the same Nastro Azzurro that sponsor Valentino Rossi during his early years in Motog? GTA Vice City? Focus and have the girl’s face as most of the poster, have the drink near her lips as if she’s drinking it and have the car in the reflection of her glasses, since she’s zoomed in there’ll be more of the car and it won’t look so stupid and transparent as a slap job marketing ad. This isn\\'t a race poster, this is a beer ad. Ah yes, the real focus of this GP. This is good....as a Peroni poster\\n\\nBad F1 poster though. Will it be painted to look like the ocean?

Love the helmet. But are all the helmets this weekend about to look the same :D? Gasly, Max and now Alonso all look pretty similar. Going with the Miami Beach look, that looks good! Miami Vice colours and palm trees? Muy original. I see they went with the vaporwave theme. How original. Nothing beats Maimi! If only the Alpine looked like this It seems as if everyone is bringing a new helmet design to Miami.\\n\\nI feel like I need to buy a Hawaiian shirt or something just to watch the race Great stuff OP > Secondly do you expect any copyright issues going forward? \\n\\nYou should absolutely expect issues may arise, especially if one of F1\\'s broadcasters decides they want to do similar videos or features.

The smiling Australian had a volatile debut season at McLaren, but is also in 2022 slower than teammate Lando Norris.\\n\\nRicciardo was brought in for his experience in the top of the field. In his time at Red Bull Racing, the Australian was still able to pick up the occasional victory. When Max Verstappen joined in 2016, he was sometimes able to outpace even the 2021 world champion. Nevertheless, the overall trend surrounding Ricciardo\\'s arrival at McLaren is currently disappointing. The Australian still has a contract until 2023 and therefore enough time to prove himself, but there are also alternatives for the team from Woking.\\n\\n**Alternatives**\\n\\nBrown states in conversation with Formula1.com: \"We have one more season together after this year and of course we are already thinking about the long term.\" Whether that will be with Ricciardo or without the Australian, Brown does not say. **He does hint, however, that there are plenty of alternatives ready. \"We will test with Pato \\\\[O\\'Ward\\\\] and Colton \\\\[Herta\\\\],\" he says.** Brown wants to postpone the decision on whether or not to extend the contract with Ricciardo. \"It\\'s best not to commit to these things too early and we\\'re not in a hurry,\" he explains of the eight-time race winner\\'s tenure.\\n\\n**Ricciardo feeling better**\\n\\nApart from the contract, Brown sees Ricciardo doing better at McLaren this year. \"Yes, he definitely is. His races are going better and he has won something in qualifying as well,\" the 50-year-old American says. The man who took Carlos Sainz\\'s spot at McLaren is also a year on. \"He\\'s not quite comfortable in the car yet, but his bond with Lando is more than good. He has also got to know the team very well\", Brown explains. After last season\\'s dip in form, Brown is therefore pleased that Ricciardo has found his way up the ladder. \"Of course we are happy that he is back on top himself,\" he concludes. Why would they hurry? There\\'s plenty of time to negotiate indeed, since he\\'s signed until the end of the next season. Can you blame them? If Ricciardo continues to slump around in the lower midfield while Lando challenges for podiums, I wouldn\\'t be at all surprised if McLaren buy out his contract and go with a new driver for 2023.\\n\\nWhen it\\'s all said and done, I think Ricciardo while be viewed as a capable driver that made some bad career decisions and survived off his Red Bull reputation for a bit too long. ive been around here for a few years and I\\'ve never seen such hate for Danny, its like he killed everyone\\'s dogs. Really not sure where its coming from tbh Daniel is only 32...he\\'s got a lot left to give in Formula One. I\\'m just amazed how far his performances have dipped. I guess he\\'s really sensitive to the car; if it\\'s not working to his liking, the results will be average/below average. What he had at Red Bull and to a degree at Renault isn\\'t translating over at McLaren. I don\\'t know what people are talking about tbh. He was absolutely off the pace on Bahrain but obviously recovering from covid and lack of track action. \\nIn Saudi he qualified next to Norris and with only a tenth between them and his race pace was great before his retirement. \\nIn Australia he qualified a few places down on Lando but finished the race only half a second behind him. \\nIn Imola, again only a few places down in qualifying on Lando, finished directly behind I\\'m in the sprint, then his race was fucked in turn 1. Partially his fault but Bottas hit him anyway which damaged his car and ruined any fightback.  but he kept going the rest of the race with a damaged car getting good data for the team. \\n\\nHe\\'s a little short of Norris ATM, same as Carlos is a little short of Leclerc, Perez a little short of Max and Hamilton a little short of Russell. But it\\'s not like last year where he clearly could not get a handle on the car. Its logical for McLaren to do that. Sadly Daniel since 2021 has big decline of form - losing to Lando especially in qualies, adaptation problems in \\'21 (thanks to that McLaren was P4 not P3) and only had 2-3 flashes. For person who was in TOP 5 2020 drivers it is unacceptable. I don\\'t see Ricciardo staying after 2023 if he keeps struggling that much compared to Norris, but in F1 a lot can change in that timeframe. I sure hope he will improve his race pace. Oh Ricciardo, I really hope you can prove the doubters wrong buddy. Yeah, I listened to the podcast and this is clickbait.  If Danny performs well this year (and he has been on par with Lando every race except the shunt at Imola where he was right with Lando), he will get another deal.  But of course McLaren wants to see what their young drivers can do.  Every team feels that way. Should hold on; then grab a senior Porsche seat to help them get a grip early. Feels like a good fit with his late braking and all. Unless something picks up with Daniel I can see them getting O\\'Ward or another one of the indy guys in Good, he\\'s too much of a wildcard atm. Needs to pull off a miracle in these next few races before we can even begin thinking of a future for Ricc at McLaren. Huge fan, love to see him in his prime again! I feel like ricciardo is absolutely no certainty to retain his seat atm. His performance would need to lift substantially to justify an extension I would’ve thought I think Danny was just really suited to Red Bull cars. He was known for breaking at the very last second and for his ballsy overtakes. I get the feeling that the McLaren is just a different type of car, and he is not suited to driving it. I bet if you could put him back in a RBR car he would be placing a lot better, but the fact that he has a huge salary and is getting beat by Lando are already two strikes. Zak mentions looking to the future, we all know that means putting an American driver in the second seat. Unfortunately, you don’t look to the future with a guy his age in F1 anymore. It is a young man’s game now. I think he would just retire. He has said many times that if he can’t win a WDC then what’s the point. He has more than enough money, he will just land in LA and have a bunch of sex. \\n\\nI don’t really see him doing anything else in F1, frankly the guy is as dumb as a bag of hammers. But he looks good, so he will be just fine. I still don’t get the Renault move he made, if not for the crazy money than what else would be the reason to go to a team whose engine just ruined your last shot at a WDC? He is completely lost in that McLaren, for sure. But who could do better.\\n\\nI don\\'t think there\\'s neither a better driver available nor an amazing rookie waiting for that seat.\\n\\nMaybe they could reach an agreement with Alpine and sign Piastri (and maybe even use Renault motors, that could be benefitial for both as the Mercedes PU is quite weak and Alpine could use the data analysis of two more cars), but I don\\'t know. Smart from them, I\\'d go for someone else surely. WELP .. Pato O’Ward should get his seat! \\n\\nTwo Mexicans in F1 would be so amazingly cool. I love Danny Ric as much as the next one, but his stay at McLaren has been underwhelming. Racking up this kind of salary to perform at a mediocre level, most of the time below his teammate, doesn\\'t look great. Maybe McLaren value his PR-power and technical insights more than we understand, but performance wise it\\'s hard to justify keeping him for the salary he has [deleted] He doesn’t belong in f1 anymore I would love to see him replaced by Piastri.\\n\\nIf you win F3 / F2 back to back, you\\'re good, and deserve a shot. RIC had his shot. Now that I\\'m used to the 18 inch rims, these things look tiny lol I believe that\\'s actually the Renault 2020 car, the RS20. OT: I really liked Slovenia when I went there Where did you see this? As a Slovenian I feel it\\'s my duty to go see it in person. where in slovenia excatly is this? Holy bargeboards The nose has ALO\\'s 14, but towards the back of the car, you see Ocon\\'s 31. Hmmmmm. Thats actually tadej pogacar is it just more or does that look very short?! That actually looks like a real car but it’s 2020 not 2021 I think based on the barge boards and the vents right behind the halo which I don’t think they had in 2021 FWIW its not last years car, or any other years. Its a show car - a fake car with a mix of parts, in many cases they are things that were never even for another car, and in some extreme cases (red bull are known for this) the car is a plastic shell. I’m so happy we got rid of barge boards. Fucking hideous. They look so clunky and boxy now, especially with all that greebling. Saward only wrote that de Vries might be a good candidate for a Latifi swap. He did not write that they were in any contact. *sees Latifi’s seat*\\n\\n\\n“Huh. I wonder who that’s for.” Whether he ever gets a seat in F1 or not - I hope Sky hires the guy for more broadcasts. He has the insight of a Nico in his analysis - and a somewhat similar impressive grasp of the English language - but seems to connect way better with the grid when doing interviews. **De Vries surprised by Williams rumours: \\'Wonder where they got that from\\'.**\\n\\nKimberley Hoefnagel\\n\\nThursday, 28 April 2022 14:56 - Last update: 15:05\\n\\nGPFans spoke exclusively with the people involved for this article\\n\\nNyck de Vries has not yet had any contact with the Williams team about a possible switch to Formula 1, he told GPFans. The driver from Sneek is not aware of the rumours and emphasises that he will continue to focus on his Formula E campaign.\\n\\nEarlier this week, there were rumours in the British media that the Williams team would be interested in bringing Nyck de Vries in. The British team would like to continue without Nicholas Latifi in 2023 and is therefore looking for his replacement. According to Sky Sports, the team has its sights set on Alpine reserve driver Oscar Piastri. However, Joe Saward, a renowned Formula One journalist, said that Williams doubts that this is the right move. The team would rather work on its own future by putting someone in that seat who is not linked to another team. De Vries was put forward as the best candidate.\\n\\n**De Vries responds to rumours**\\n\\nDe Vries himself, however, has no idea where this rumour came from. \"These rumours are new to me,\" the 27-year-old told GPFans in an exclusive interview. \"I have no idea where you read them \\\\[the rumours, ed.\\\\] or where you came across them. But then I\\'m very curious where they got that from,\" the Mercedes driver stressed. \"Because honestly, I have no idea.\"\\n\\nAsked if De Vries would consider a move to Williams, he replied: \"Of course, Formula 1 is a dream. That is a dream for every young driver, but otherwise I think it is still quite early in the season. We are only at the sixth race in our championship. So yes, let\\'s first make sure we get a few points here again,\" said the Dutchman.\\n\\nTranslated with [www.DeepL.com/Translator]( (free version) De Vries is one of those guys who went under radar because guys like Mick get F1 seat thanks to their name and guys like Mazepin got their seat by just money.\\n\\nMazepin won same amount races as Mick in F2 season but he had the 5th best team, Not prema. Tsunoda won 3 awards in F2 that season for a reason. Coming to Singapore for the first time this year!! Very excited. \\n\\nWhat are the major tourist attractions that would be good to do during the day/late afternoon before the F1 sessions? \\n\\nIs there a lot of food options that will be open late at night after the F1 sessions? \\n\\nWhat is the best transport from (idk the area), but from Geylang Road (near ‘Eminent Frog Porridge’?) to the track?\\n\\nIs it easiest to get from the airport to the city via rail? And is google maps reliable for public transport? \\n\\nSorry for all the questions haha Nice to see a fellow sinkie F1 fan here My favourite place to go in SG is Boon Tong Kee, they have many locations but I can\\'t resist their Steamed Chicken and Rice, Crispy bean curd.\\nAlso frog leg porridge at 4 am tastes good too. Finally...singapore fans How nice of you to do this, thank you. \\n\\nI’m a Singaporean myself (haha) and looking to attend this year GP after following f1 religiously since 2019. Understand that the early bird tickets were sold out so looking to get one closer to the date. Having said that, which area/zone/ticket will give me the most value and how many days would you suggest I should attend? Any other tips are appreciated! where can I buy one of those half cooked egg makers where you just pour boiling water it? nice work fellow sg lad Is there any seb singapore merch being sold near the track. I think I saw a few images of them sold in local shops as he is the lion of Singapore I have been to Singapore many many times and am looking forward to the GP this year, as far as the GP goes, what is the premier location to view the race from the track and what is the best post race venue? Any recommendations for areas to stay at? I’ll be at the Bay Grandstand and a bit lost at the moment on where to stay - lodgings wise I mean. I got a ticket to the pit grandstand! Taking an extended vacation from work this year as I’m working far too much and finishing it with the race. Splurging on accommodations and the tickets but I love street food! Fancy parties aren’t my thing. Any highlights for hawker centres near the track area? I love walking through cities, best way to get a feel for the place so if it’s a few kilometres away that’s all good! \\n\\nAdditionally, are the concerts an all day or night thing? Can’t wait to experience this! Thanks so much for doing this!!!\\n\\nDo you know in general where drivers come in to the track so we have the opportunity for a picture or autograph?\\nRight now my wife and I have tickets for Turn 1 which gets us access to all four Zones I believe.\\n\\nWe’re also staying for a week after the race. Anything you recommend we go do on weekdays where there are less crowds possibly?\\n\\nThanks!!! Booked my flight just a few days ago, coming from the US (Houston, Texas) and have a few general questions  \\n\\\\- In markets and food centres, are transactions mostly cashless or do you always need to carry a good amount of cash?  \\n\\\\- What is the scene like around the circuit both before and after the events each evening?  Packed bars and convenience shops, difficult to get around, etc?  \\n\\\\- Does it take long to get in/out of the track area, like how much time should you budget for ticket scanning, finding seats, food and drink lines, etc?  \\n\\\\- I\\'ve been told I must try Chili Crab, as such any recommendations for Chili Crab locales? We were hoping to go to the GP as we are vacationing in Bali at that time, but a 3 hour flight is just a bit too far for a one day trip. We will be sure to plan it better next year. have fun you all! I depart in the morning to go to Miami for my first Grand Prix!! Have tickets in the turn 1 grandstands. Does anyone have any advice? Really excited for the GP, most of the track looks like it should be fun from a racing standpoint and from a viewers standpoint. \\n\\nI still hate the overly tacky couple of bits, but depending on how the race is directed, I hope I won\\'t have to see the stupid marina and beach more than once. I don\\'t understand the rampant hate for this GP before it\\'s even happened once. So many F1 fans are just obnoxiously stuck in the past All this hype around Miami feels like F1 is trying to replace Monaco. Does anyone know if RedBull brought further upgrades to Miami? Or are they running their Imola update package? This feels like the ultimate \"apples to oranges\" comparison where there is no correct answer, but here goes:\\n\\nWhat is the best part of any track to be a viewer at?  In other words, if you could have a front row seat to any place on the F1 calendar, where are you sitting?\\n\\nIs it where the track is?  Is it how good the racing is at that specific part?  Is it how good a look you get at the action? US people going to Montreal - what is your strategy for getting tested before returning to the US?\\n\\nOur hotel is kind of boutique-ey so it\\'s not offering in-hotel testing.  They sent me to this service - Biron - that is expensive but does testing.\\n\\nI\\'m wondering if there is anything else I\\'m missing.  Thanks I’m watching the Classic USA 1982 F1 race in Las Vegas on Sky F1, what a terrible looking track! I didn’t realise it genuinely was in the car park of Caesar’s Palace, looks like it was throw together in a few days. I’m genuinely beyond excited for the Miami GP. This is hyped up a lot by the videos and F1’s investment. Looks very exciting! Has any Grand Prix been hyped as much as Miami this year? \\n\\nSingapore 2008 might be that one as it was the first ever night race in F1 but I don\\'t think any other race matched the hype Does anyone know of any F1 related things to see outside of the circuit itself? I know that there’s a Red Bull show car in front of one of the hotels, and there’s a Williams pop up somewhere, but other than that I’m not sure of anything happening around the city. Austin was great for a few years when it came to F1 stuff to see around town! I\\'m in the UK, where the F1 TV app doesn\\'t work for live streaming (without a vpn) but does anyone know if you can watch recent races (the day after, or week after?)\\n\\nI know it offers historic races, but I just want to know how recent of a race you can watch. What happened to that \"Show and tell\" thing they were introducing this year? I assume I have just completely missed it but I thought it would be a bigger deal when I first heard about it Iv only just got back into F1, but I feel SkyF1 are very pushy in terms of getting in the drivers faces, etc and they had an interview with Christian on the pit wall mid race!!!! How do you add the F1teams to your reddit name? How are race distances determined? As far as I know they have to be at least 300km.\\n\\nI\\'ve come to learn that the upcoming Miami GP will be around 308km. So why is it this and why not one lap less or one lap more?\\n\\nThanks. Question for some of you Grand Prix veterans: the Miami Grand Prix will be the first for my friend and I. We have seats at turn 18 and I couldn\\'t be more excited to actually watch in person. Just wondering, what\\'s the best way to watch? Have the F1TV international broadcast playing in headphones for commentary? Is there much of a delay? Or will the screens+production there be good enough to follow what\\'s happening? Any other tips and tricks are super appreciated! Are ticket prices normally this high for an F1 race? I was so excited when they announced the GP in Miami and was planning on going. It would be my first GP but prices are soo high I\\'m discouraged to purchase a ticket at the current prices. I\\'m looking every 30 min for ticket price changes! Does anyone know a good place to purchase tickets? Or even have an extra one? Honestly any advice is appreciated. thanks! Over/Under on how many times we see Brady and Jordan on race day? I am genuinely excited, not just because it is in the states, but I like seeing new tracks. \\n\\nWith that said, was there ever any talk about holding it at night? I mean, I understand the issue with timing, and having a race at 01-0300 in Europe, but racing under the lights at this track would be amazing. Anyone know of watch parties in NYC? Not usually my thing but Miami seems like a good one to watch with a crew. I want to learn more about the science behind the cars. Does anyone have good resources? I am very knowledgeable about physics so I will take any references. Idc if it\\'s meant for a child or a PhD I have an extra room at the Eden Roc for Miami. The hotels are now going for $1,200 USD a night. I paid $300 and would be willing to transfer to someone for the $300 a night rate… best place to offer this up? I am currently awaiting my requests to join some Facebook groups for Miami. How was ferrari allowed to test a new floor during the pirelli tyre tests ? 40% of rain on Sunday in Miami 👀 Why Are you guys so hard to please? Anyone else surprised that nascar is having their Darlington race at the same time as the Miami GP? I don\\'t personally like nascar myself but I\\'m wondering which series decided on that timeslot first, and if the other decided to compete directly by design, or if it\\'s just an unfortunate coincidence.\\n\\nWondering what the fans of both series think of this. I do love F1 for making one of the few races on the calendar that I could have a drink during since its not on at 8am happen on mothers day so I get to miss it on the road... I don’t watch much Sports Center and I’m not in Florida, but disappointed in the lack of hype for this race in the general media. Seems like there was a lot of talk after Texas last year. Not sure what I’m expecting but it seems to be very quiet. Does anyone know anything about the relationship in the garage at Alfa? I feel like I’ve heard relatively little about the team despite decent performances from Bottas and Zhou (just saw they are 4th in Constructors) I’ve heard rumours about a Ricciardo-Gasly swap, does this rumour have any merit. Or is it just something to gain attention? It is so annoying how hard they’re pushing the GP. Sending George to a heat game, LeClerc, checo and max to a marlins game, Pierre meeting Jordan and Lewis with Tom Brady. No Fernando at the Miami opening?? Not sure why F1 is going with the \"So Bad It\\'s Good\" approach for this race, any idea? Has there ever been an F! race where they just threw up a race track and no one really knew what was gonna happen on it like this? From my understanding, Miami has a lot of long straights and Red Bull has been the fastest on the straights. Therefore, Max is the favorite this weekend. Is this thinking correct? Anyone order Miami merch from Mclaren? Just curious if anyone has had their order ship yet? I ordered on launch day and only got an order email, nothing about shipping yet. Was hoping to get it before the race Sunday. What\\'s the best site for buying GP tickets second hand? I\\'ll be in Houston during the USGP on Oct 23, I found some tickets on seatgeek, is that any good? Is miami open to general track/race activities beyond f1 like Cota? Or is this strictly an f1 venue? When do you think the season\\'s first race without a safety car will be? I feel like the DRS will be overpowered here, the one in the finish straigh line looks fine, but the other 2 seems to long. Can someone explain the water meme that’s been going around before the Miami gp? Anyone going to Baku? Recommendation on hotels hey guys, i see you pop up on my frontpage from tiem to time so i think of you guys once in awhile. \\n\\nwell today a live streamer (his name is Jake) was invited by the mclaren racing team(?) so hes in the cars and in the pits :) Any Charlotte NC fans in here? so what will be the fast lap time in practice\\n\\nwill there be any safety cars in the race i say yes I need to get this off my chest. Other than COTA, the f1 season should not recur in the USA. Not Las Vegas or Miami. It feels like an money making machine now, why would they give the USA out of all countries three races. It’s beginning to feel like a joke at this point. I’m actually looking forward to hearing some peoples opinion. But this is driving me crazy, the tracks they create now seem so familiar, it’s so annoying, at least take DRS out now if the cars can race closer. And for the love of god design a track that isn’t walled off. Make it safer and more accessible to other sports. Adopt new tracks just don’t create these long straights where that’s the only way to overtake. It’s getting annoying at this point, 22 races is too much. Drivers know they can afford to DNF out of 1-2 races and still win the championship. Make it less, make every rave worth more. Okay I’m done He\\'s a shit person, a bad driver and his country\\'s government is fucking up but Nikita\\'s 2022 [helmet]( was nice as hell. Is there any elevation change around the Miami track or is it all flat? I\\'m not super privy on how the point system has worked over the years, but has a championship (or maybe even a position in the standings) been decided by a fastest lap? If not, is it possible (with current system)? Ok so we know that track time is limited in f1 cars. The only times they can practice is during fp1 etc. \\n\\nBut what\\'s dripping them from getting in an f2 car and taking it out to get a feel for the track? Does anyone know anything about the relationship in the garage at Alfa? I feel like I’ve heard relatively little about the team despite decent performances from Bottas and Zhou (just saw they are 4th in Constructors) English version \\n\\nFor the first time, a Formula 1 race weekend will take place in Miami. The route in the Sunshine State is therefore completely unknown - the drivers could only test it using the simulator.\\nThe fans are all the more excited about the performance of the individual camps and which updates can be expected. After the debacle in Imola, special focus is on Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton, for whom the new terrain in Florida could also be an opportunity.\\nOpponent Red Bull, on the other hand, is on top after the double victory in the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari. World champion Max Verstappen won ahead of teammate Sergio Perez and at the same time caused disillusionment at the Scuderia, which could not live up to its expectations at the Ferrari home game.\\nWorld championship leader Charles Leclerc finished sixth, Carlos Sainz retired.\\nNevertheless, the outcome of the coming race weekend - not least because of the unfamiliar track - is completely open.\\nSaid street circuit, the Miami International Autodrome, which runs around the Hard Rock Stadium of the Miami Dolphins, has many challenging corners and a 1.28 km long straight ready, in which top speeds of up to 320 km/h can be reached. Three DRS zones also provide a spectacle.\\nThe pay TV station broadcasts the race I\\'m just glad Mazepin is not racing this track.\\n\\nFeel bad for Latifi already tho.'"

       "'Translated by DeepL  The FIA is going to enforce more strictly the rule that drivers are not allowed to wear jewelry and wear their own nonfireproof clothing Indeed it will become part of the technical inspection of the car  It was before the Australian Grand Prix that the driver notes prepared by the race director highlighted some already existing rules Drivers were not allowed to wear jewelry nor were they allowed to wear their own clothing that was not homologated by the FIA Lewis Hamilton among others took umbrage and indicated that he would in fact be wearing more while Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff was surprised by the new race directors focus points Is this the battle they want to take on Hamilton now Well if this is the worst were not complaining  Teams now actually risk a penalty  That mention of rules that have been in place for a long time had to be read as a warning at the time as it now appears Now in fact the FIA is going a step further Before the start of each weekend the teams have to sign a document declaring that the car complies with the technical regulations Now however two additional passages have been included on that form The teams have to declare that the drivers do not wear any jewelry and therefore do not wear their own clothing RacingNews365 has seen the document with these new passages  These two aspects are now part of the technical inspection of the cars which means that if they are not met the teams registration must be considered illegal Normally this will result in an exclusion from the race but in practice it is possible that a fine or a grid penalty will be imposed   Toto Wolff already reacted to the shifting of the rules in the presence of RacingNews365 and has now expressed a more nuanced opinion We have to remember why the FIA is doing this namely to prevent injuries caused by jewelry Nobody is waiting for a freak accident in which that plays a part so the FIA has to draw a line somewhere Is this a key issue I dont think so but I understand where its coming from “So What’s the dress code”  “Business Racing” Inspired by the colour of flag that he will see more of this season The checkered sleeves are a homage to the type of flag he used to see ahead of others in the past seasons Aaaaaaaaaaand as always he looks like a pretentious knob This is half the reason I dont like the guy hes always got to try and make a statement The sleeve reminded me of HP sponsored Williams Is “his blue outfit” a thing… Bruh how is this man not sweating buckets Hamilton switching to Corvette Racing in IMSA confirmed Zhous shorts are stylish Instagram story of both of them I think Max is wearing his GF’s glasses 6 drivers 3 cars the Red Bull academy has too many drivers not enough seats Jesus look at the Williams’ top speed If only they could figure the rest out Williams The best or nothing Dont forget to peg Bottas as your Monaco winner in fantasy Note These are broad categories thus not every corner type is accounted for McLaren for example excel in MediumHigh speed corners and mediumLow however this is not included to make it more simple Very surprising that Mercedes showed up so well in medium and high speed corners as well as on the straights It would seem that porpoising would prove the most disruptive there These look correct Haas does its best on Medium speed corner what track is best for that Direct link to Video here HQ That T1 camera crane must be higher than any of the guests in Miami this weekend Volume up The only thing Im not looking forward to this weekend is baking in the sun  Wonder what the track surface will be like Original Resolution Images from tweet   Image 1   Image 2   Image 3 Is that a Miamispecific livery Eh that livery is way too busy for me So much going on its almost like camouflage Slightly unrelated but the BH Jordan had a pretty good color scheme didnt it That paint looks heavy lol That paint looks heavy lol I love the air intake It’s perfect Looks a battery Maybe a bit out of place but it’s great I love the Duracell design Until the brakes explode Hope they fixed that issue Original Res Photo I suspect they need to reduce drag as the car is designed to gain most of its downforce trough the floor Less drag could also result in less porpoising as we see DRS also results in less porpoising The downside is that they lose downforce in general So if they can’t fully utilize their floor they car is just flawed beyond repair The best or nothing Are all of the Merc changes marginal  incremental this far in 2022 Yup thats it thats the key Let’s fucking go I guess this is a good time for Ben to see how things are being run over in America First meeting Roger Penske to discuss Indycar and now meeting Jim for NASCAR Saturday Race 1  230p ET ESPNEWSESPN3  Sunday Race 2  1035a ET ESPN2  More info about all this here Nice This is big news for them How long till we get a female F1 driver MotoGP satellite teams dont buy chassis Moto2Moto3 teams do howevever they buy entire bikes with motors gearbox and all from factories It’s close enough to a spec series to call it one And being a spec series isn’t negative the actual racing in Indy is fantastic As a massive Indycar fan it is essentially a spec series IndyCar is a spec series though K sir this is a wendys Much like FE it’s a mostly spec series I suppose this post was meant to be posted in rIndyCar  IndyCar is between being a ‘spec series’ and an ‘open development’ series Being in the middle bewteen both approaches allows them to attract new teams as theres development on the table while keeping the costs reasonable Its a similar approach to what Formula E has been chasing lately   The ‘spec series’ part of the equation allows IndyCar to have close racing Despite being in a Meyer Shank car or in a Dayle Coyne car you still have the chance to fighg for pole positions and race wins That’s something which doesn’t happen on series with ‘open development’   Having free development on shocks and dampers doesn’t make IndyCar a series focused on ‘open development’ It’s a very important part of the car but it’s not the whole car Letting IndyCar teams fully develop the chassis and have special partnerships with engine manufacturers would only skyrocket the operational costs of IndyCar   For all intents and purposes IndyCar is still considered as a ‘spec series’ because of the same chassis gearbox body which is ultimately what the spectator and average fan will look for The racing is still pretty much what you would find on a ‘spec series’ like Formula E or Formula 2   IndyCar is in the middle of the road and that way of operating has been beneficial to them Ive been getting into the ferrari challenge series It is a super spec series   The cars are 100 identical and yet there are still like 10 static adjustments you can make and 6 realtime adjustments   Spec means that the cars are mostly identical as opposed to open or box designs  Indy falls closest to the Spec category Can’t imagine that being too comfortable in the Miami heat When you have to meet with the Queen at 2 but going skiing at 3 straight outta mortal kombat Mans never hot Isn’t it like blistering hot in Miami right now This is one of the first Lewis fits that I am genuinely confused by Blueis Hamilton I love this one  Usually cant stand them

so Hanoi isnt real Ive been hating a fake track for years So Nice catch  When I watched the Miami F1 2022 gameplay I was genuinely confused for a moment thinking it was was Vietnam lol Valtteri’s social media shenanigans don’t get enough appreciation but dudes more active than almost any other driver on the grid when it comes to random wittyenjoyable content It’s incredible You can see the Instagram video of this here  Valtteri is clearly having fun xD He really is living his best life these days isnt he Good for him In all fairness to the pose he is about the size of one of their cheerleaders So is there a sports team in and around the Miami area that an F1 driver hasnt been to see in the past 4 days VB always looks like one of the biggest drivers  but those dudes make him look tiny No Tua in sight  ESPN later today F1 driver also hates Tua Brazzers Bottas a fin with the fins Laces out This has way too much NSFW meme potential And you know exactly what im talking about

darn cuddly looks like the intro of a porn movie XD Just some guys being dudes Lol F1 drivers are tiny Well at least its not weird No no no I love how it’s about racing  fun so tired of people on social media pushing their personal agendas HAMBURG May 5 Reuters An agreement for Volkswagens VOWGpDE premium brand Audi to join Formula One by investing in British luxury sports carmaker McLaren is becoming increasingly unlikely a person familiar with the project told Reuters on Thursday  The price expectations are too far apart the person said adding that while the project had not yet failed its prospects are now close to zero  Meanwhile talks with Swissbased Sauber which runs the Ferraripowered Alfa Romeo team and Williams are continuing the person said Both Audi and Volkswagen declined to comment A tale as old as time Always has been I see that McLaren is doing everything to be customer and have almost 0  chance for title fight Is this a sabotage or something  I really hope they buy Williams they could use a helping hand More detail on new wing changes from Scarbs More analysis on new FW by Scarbs These just some regular downforce adaptations to a track rather then a true differentiator of airflow or something radical Are these the radical changes Mercedes is gonna bring to become P1 again They can’t change the nose without a new crash test right So the 3 kg is all in the wingswingtips I honestly don’t see 3 kg there but whatev Is this the only update they brought You can polish a turd but at the end of the day it’s still a piece of shit Old looks better FUTURRRRREEE Face Lift Mario Party Mini Game Its Florida theres always a chance for rain its what happens when you build your state on a swamp That pretty normal for this time of year  This is actually good bit hot weather for Miami  This is just showing there is the chance for a quick 30min1hr pop us shower  Very heavy rain chance but it is usually quick Its a peninsula  It rains frequently  I lived there for a few years and its super common for a single cloud to roll through and drop an inch or two of rain in the span of 30 minutes then go back to sunny Weather apps doesnt tell us a lot theyre all based of a computer model with no human input Just watch the TV meteorologist or check NWS Miami on the morning of race Source Im a meteorologist When I lived in God’s Waiting Room it seemed to rain everyday in the morning and afternoon for a 20 minute shower 39 chance of getting 7 one hundredths of an inch  rain in the forecast We might get some real water in the marina Surprised nobody has made a joke about the fake marina yet Yes…maybe…meh 40 chance of rain with a high of 90F lmao Event goers are about to know what it feels like to lose 10lb in an afternoon Florida weather  It could rain real hard for a couple of minutes or it could do that nearby and completely miss you  It’s pretty random The lights make it look cool I like this one It’s different than the

Missed Apex is the way  Matt Trumpets NYC guy in particular is a knowledgeable yet very understandable F1 pundit Idk if its the best but ShiftF1 have a primer episode to get you informed Its episode 178 Missed Apex gets my vote   Also i would just skip to season 4 of D2S and watch it Its interesting to see where the teams finished and where theyre at currently F1 nation official F1 race preview and reviews especially the race reviews got a lot better this year with direct interviews from the paddock with drivers and other team personnel Missed Apex and F1 Beyond the Grid Any time Joe Saward is on Missed Apex is what you should listen to I like Scuderia F1 podcast Missed Apex is my favorite The panel is great and occasionally hilarious ShiftF1 podcast  It’s a longterm US podcast but very accessible They have a preseason primer episode to get you up to speed I quite enjoy Missed Apex They can be biased towards Lewis especially end of 2021 at times but I enjoy the structure of their podcast and theyre usually the first to get a show out after the race   I also like the Ringer F1 Show WTF1 just watch donut medias video on youtube on f1 Its really good and WTF1 has good information for beginners too Glad to have you in this community and i hope you start loving the sport we all fell in love with here 3 You definitely need to binge watch DTS S4 from last season beforeas you fly down there Also like other have said episode 178 from ShiftF1 is all you’ll need to listen to Id recommend back of the grid if youre a brit Not a podcast but Chain Bear on YouTube and B Sport also on YouTube have some great explanation vids on aerodynamics track regulations tyres porpoising that type of stuff Ask in daily thread Contrast and compair Zak to some of the other CEOs and damn is he an amazing personality in the sport God I wish that were me  Also didnt F1 ban plane flybys this season  I was super bummed when they announced it There are pilots and then there are the Blue Angels who are absolutely insane Wonder if Daniel or Lando would’ve wanted to go but Zak was like “Drivers can’t go Too risky Oh by the way I’m available” Thhe Blue Angels is the only thing I’ve seen in person that rivals F1INDYCAR at speed  Truly deathdefying Amazingly Blue Angels shows and Top Gun movies are net positives for the US Department of Defense  That is actually your tax dollars working for you  The recruitment benefit outweighs the expense   Also the Blue Angels are the most bad ass flying formation in the world but there is a reason the Navy wont allow the Airforces F22 to fly at naval Airshows  it is the most stunning and maneuverable airplane that will ever be built by humankind Zak definitely seems to be living his best life these days Also seems like hes been dropping weight lately no I feel the need… Man is living life Would be really cool to be a multi millionaire deleted Original Res Photo There are many posts showing this particular car its the Renault Rs20 from the 2020 season not the a521 Its got both drivers numbers on too No comment after 2 hours How are you planning on organising this gathering lol Flea market display with Gucci prices 450 for a tshirt 💀  Haas offering their caps for 30 is the only reasonable thing I remember at the Hungary GP when I was 10 I begged my parents to get me a Lewis Hamilton McLaren cap They told me its too expensive but they got me one it was 20€ Buying the haas cap cant afford to be a better fan than that Is that 130 for the purple mercedes hat or is there something below it That cant be right TIL my budget is “Haas” Even if I had it I wouldn’t spend that kind of money on a that McLaren Racing F1 New Era 940 2022 Special Edition Fade Miami Hat Is 42 on Amazon fyi Lol slap that tiny F1 logo  110 Gtfo Im good lol Haas first year cap for 40 of new big Team caps Yes please Thats a big premium on the merch Gene gaining some fans 🇺🇲🇺🇸🇩🇪🇩🇰🏁🙏 Statistically speaking how often is a sucker born Wow really judging my past self for scoffing at 20 cocktail drinks at COTA in 20162019 range that even included the nice glass it came in This weekend is going to be all sorts of level of stupid and throwing huge amounts of money away it will drive people crazy There’s always someone stupid enough to buy those prices make me think this is a tent outside of the track somewhere trying to scalp people  i dont think these are actual f1 shop prices There’s a sucker born every minute 30 bucks Haas cap lets gooooo F1flation 80 for a year old cap Seems about right Eff that 450 for a 6 button tshirt Hell no Ive dropped some serious coin at Texas GP before but I went home with a lot of stuff This is BS Looks like the same prices as Austin last year I got my cheapass 40 Austin Grand Prix hat and loved ituntil my dog ate it If I had spent 130 I might have wished the hat ate the dog since hed be cheaper to replace There’s a huge markup on this stuff You can buy the same shit on their websites for much less Probably the venue taking their cut here Is this possibly a stand that’s outside the track Or is this an official stand Pretty similar to COTA last year Looking like I’d be rooting for Haas HAAS for the people This is USD Jesus that is ridiculous prices are probably going to be outrageous at the Montreal grand prix You should look into Americas Cup merchandise This garbage in Miami is targeted at millionaires Pfft I pity  Americas Cup merch is targeted at megamillionaires   For a half a second I almost considered getting a 230 Prada Americas Cup tshirt after a friendgirl said yeah but Im pretty sure that is the least expensive Prada product ever offered for sale You might want to buy a few  Edit Im broker than shit Im just really into sailing Everyone that reads this post should look into the AC  If you didnt know 95 of AC fans are F1 fans but only like 1 of F1 fans are AC fans  AC and F1 are very similar theyre all about rules design engineering and fluid dynamics  But the AC has both aerodynamics and hydrodynamics   If you like F1 you will like the Americas Cup Its priced similarly to other prestige events like The Masters Americas cup etc   Peter Millar is just a scam tho Nothing could make me buy their sportswear All of this shit is way cheaper online 80 for a hat 110 for a shirt 🤣🤣🤣 ok I scared to even convert dollars to my currency It’s all Putin’s fault First time at a GP They’re always insanely expensive Went to Austin in 2018 and 2019 and the hats were 60 shirts and jackets were 80120 That was 34 years ago add inflation and popularity and you have todays prices Peter Millar isn’t cheap but a 14 zip pullover isn’t 450 It’s 150 tops Are these prices standard for buying at the event location I was planning to buy merch at the Canadian GP but it looks like I can only afford Haas 🥴 Polo better come with a hooker F1 is for the rich Those prices are a joke lol This is what happens when Americans buy the sport SMH Fans are counted as revenue streams only F1 and Miami two things that arent cheap honestly these prices are pretty close to normal nfl Merch in Miami at a game If you worry about prices Miami isnt for you I just dont understand the appeal It all looks like tat to me My wallet is pleased What the actual fuck And prices will only go up through the weekend Bro ☠️ Heading down there now Clearly will not be buying any merch and am going to eat a large breakfast and lunch just buy them on aliexpress few bucks Ridiculous basic shirts with a logo on it not even cool designs or whatever WTF That can’t be real Bwoah merc white cap is free right right Yet another reason to support Haas and Gunthers Go Fund Me for a new boat Teams overcoming budget cap with overpriced merch prices s Thats just sad driving people away from representing their brand When I was in Imola this year the Ferrari baseball caps were 60€ and Mercedes 40€ and I thought that was outrageous lol Does anyone buy these at these prices Beer goggle pricing Surely they would make more money in the long run by lowering the price This is nonsense Modern day pricing is usually based on demandsupply rather than a fixed margin over cost Thats why so many mega companies grow in value so much because they keep reducing their costs keep increasing their margins and keep increasing their prices While a cap might be 30 on the website they know they if you dont have it and you wanna flaunt your support for a team you are gonna get it even at a premium Hence the inflated costs for things that are relatively less expensive online That’s insane I know merch prices don’t reflect all prices but man I feel at this rate I’ll never be able to afford to go a f1 race in the US Between travel and price of tickets for more than 1 person it just isn’t possible unless I’m looking in the wrong place I remeber going to us GP COTA and hats being like 45 dollars and that was 2016 inflation hasnt gone up that much 110 dollars for a tshirt kind of pricey f1   how much is the program like 90 dollars Not abnormal for races in North America I went to Montreal in 2010 and prices were insane even then 70 for a hat 110 for a shirt and 200 for a jacket Lmao what Fanatics has this all Wheres that famous budget cap That white polo is legitimately more than a third of my monthly rent Definitely would cop that Haas hat I am so embarrassed for this whole event so far I see supply and demand is in full effect regarding the Haas  hat Always knew supporting haas would pay me back somehow haha Wait until this guy finds out how much pimento cheese sandwiches are at the masters lol Miami GP is F1 attempting a total cash grab from the American elite  And I get it F1 cars are expensive  Bummer middleclass fans are getting gouged for souvenirs Cheaper than in Brazil GP at least Well thats gross I love F1 but I feel like attending a race in person or buying the Merch is targeted for the Uber wealthy Damn Ill take that HAAS hat for 30 Are those online anywhere I remember Liberty Media saying they wanted to treat each race like the way the NFL does with the super bowl These prices would back that claim Christ they cant be serious250 for a polo i know inflation is bad but dam not that bad Why’d they do my haas like that The Crack mentality continues right down the food chain Haas being real ones I’d take a HAAS hat What The Fuck I’d buy the Haas hat Do they not sell Pirelli caps at the race what does the 450 shirt do I mean I have two kidneys so Im kind of glad everything is expensive Now i dont have to worry about spending any money while at the event I guess if you can afford 2k ticket you can spend 450 on a fking polo… god damn The team hats seem to be about the same prices they were at COTA in October I’ve never seen generic F1 merch so overpriced though Everyday Indycar becomes more and more appealing to me I mean apart from the polos… have you been to a concert recently Inflation I own zero merch because of their BS prices BRO THOSE HAAS PRICES BE BANGIN Haas with the closest to a reasonable hat price Sorry but 450 for THAT Whoa I remember going to Silverstone 2019 and it costing £80 for any teams tshirt Absolute joke I ended up getting a senna hoodie for £30 instead because if it Dont let them rip you off Jesus christ Meanwhile it looks like a flea market in a third world country I always found it interesting that the Seminole Indian tribe now completely owns Hard Rock International this makes miami RB’s fifth home race on the calendar Looks like the hump at the chicane took max off guard That long straight is just a showcase of the cars straightline speed considering theres no way to set yourself coming out of that chicane Professor Max  His ease at the wheel almost makes you think he does this kind of thing for a living I enjoyed the commentary on it as well  Hope those two kerbs arent so big in real life or his underbody might be in for a world of pain Looks cool Very long straight I assume he’s in Assetto Corsa running laps I can’t really tell what sim he’s in but I know AC has a mod with the track Interesting In the other Sim laps videos that RB posts I mentioned how he has a little twerk of his leg whenever he goes full throttle   I actually found a video from a Mexican pr thing with Albon where you could see both drivers legs Max did it as well Alex didnt  But in this video no twerk Or maybe its the camera angle right between his legs Is that the actual Red Bull sim That chicane is like a cannon Comparison between the new rear wing and the old one via Duchessa Dear lord even more colors popping on that Merc car  I think it’s the same front wing but with a different adjustment They should replace the Petronas accent colors with these new color patterns Weird livery Seeing magnussen do well is such a great story So incredibly happy for him Hopefully Mick can bring his performance at least on par with K Mags It certainly does Schumacher is in a car that can score points and hes failed to deliver so far David Coulthard Mick Schumachers future depends on Magnussen duel  If Mick Schumacher wants a future in Formula 1 he must not look old against Kevin Magnussen  The Dane is a surprise for David Coulthard  Author Norman Fischer  CoAuthor Erwin Jaeggi  05052022 1725  David Coulthard Mick Schumachers future depends on Magnussen duel  Mick Schumachers future in Formula One depends heavily on how he fares against his Haas teammate Kevin Magnussen says former driver David Coulthard Schumacher was seen as a rising star after his convincing performances against Nikita Masepin in his first year but has stagnated somewhat this season  For so far Schumacher has been pretty much disenchanted by Magnussen The Dane made his Formula 1 comeback at short notice after a year out and has scored points in three out of four races so far Magnussen has already scored 15 points while Schumacher along with Nicholas Latifi is one of only two regular drivers without points  Micks future depends in many ways on the comparison with Kevin Coulthard told the Dutch edition of Motorsportcom at an IWC Schaffhausen charity event at Miami Beach Golf Club  When you get into Formula One you are given a rookie year but then you have to deliver the Scot said People dont wait for you to be quick You have to be  Mick beats Magnussen only with hard work  So far the Germans career has actually gone to plan Schumacher was champion in Formula 3 and Formula 2 and according to Coulthard also had a very good first season in which he established himself  The unknown however was the comparison with teammate Nikita Masepin Schumacher was clearly in control of the latter though the Haas was too slow to compete with other cars But with the arrival of Magnussen and the better performance of Haas there is now a comparison  and in that Schumacher is currently still inferior  In Kevin he now has someone he can only beat with hard work says Coulthard preferring to highlight the Danes performance rather than belittle that of his predecessor Masepin The fact that hes consistently getting the Haas into the points shows that it was the right decision to bring him back  Coulthard Magnussen drives liberated  But the fact that he currently has such a grip on Schumacher also surprises the former vice world champion He explains it in such a way that Magnussen had actually already finished with Formula 1 and is now getting another unexpected second chance in which he has nothing to lose  It seems he is driving liberated he says In his first career with McLaren and Haas there was always some anger in his style  Now however Magnussen is simply driving consistently well and is 31 up against Schumacher in both qualifying and race duels go to overview Mick has had it quite easy against Masepin so far but now he has realised that he has a fast teammate in Kevin And that has pushed Mick He has to step up now said Coulthard  I think its a fascinating battle It will be interesting to see how Haas will develop No Very cool thanks How do you find out about the pop ups The Race Is Lewis Outmatched by Guanyu A sith drip lord Boy got drip

Getting his win this weekend fellas Cant wait until McLaren cuts this guy Get my guy some AC Did bro dirty lmao That Mercedes has sidepods XD Are those the old tyres Why do they look so weird That thing is in the background  I know what it is I also know that no one was asking  my hand shot up faster than a fat kid asking for seconds  Its called Flys Eye Dome and it was designed by Buckminster Fuller This is a recreation in the courtyard of the Art Museum I first saw it at Art Basel Miami Side pod Merc Side pod Merc Side pod Merc Damn theres no way its that hot there where at in miami What´ s with the W13 The floor is different the previous Side Pods but on the other hand a new and much thinner rear wing Heres hoping they dial back the sensationalism somewhat  Seems like some drivers and teams are pretty upset about last season and less footage isnt going to help them  They definitely could have made a more compelling ie true story out of last season I think One episode will be about the rivalry between Latifi and walls I feel like best case scenario is they mend some bridges with a less sensationalised season 5 and season 6 goes back to what it once was  Otherwise itll just be Red Bull Steiner Christian Horner Zak Brown Geri Horner Danny Ric and Christian Horner by the end Guaranteed that Miami gets its own episode Hopefully the series reinvents itself because it desperatly needs to  The quality has been on a decline since S1 Steady at first with S2 then sharper with S3 and off a cliff with S4 Season 4 was for sure the weakest but hopefully they  F1  Liberty  FOM take any criticism from fans and the teams to refine the format I just need Toto to say Pumpernickel once an episode I dont think its an unreasonable request I’m pretty sure by the end of those 2 seasons no drivers will be willing to participate They haven’t been happy with their portrayal on the large This last season was so bad I hope they rethink how they are doing things I hope the attrocious reception of the latest season prompts them to dial down the fake drama and focus on the real stuff a bit more I cant fathom how they managed to fuck up the last season the perfect material for a banger of a season was right there and instead they focused on Mazepins early pitstop They also manged to anger some drivers which could have been easily avoided Hell ask some of them about their best moments and tough battles and you might even start endearing yourself to them Will Buxton on Twitter 😂    2 more years of having to hear about people who hate the series so much that they wont watch They should expand the number of races episodes Hope 5  6 are better than 4 That last one was a snorefest Im here for more Haas episodes Season V Guenther strikes back Hopefully theyll take some of the criticisms on board and focus on storylines that are actually happening instead of just manipulating the footage and the interviews to tell whatever narrative they want to tell                            And while were wishing for far fetched things I want a date with Gahyeon from Dreamcatcher Cant wait to watch about heroic Prince Charles slaying the Satan Max next season Heres to 2 more seasons that releases during the season opener rather than the season break where it would be more sensible to watch Formula 1 gatekeepers in shambles 😐😐😐 It’s pretty early to confirm and for the first time it comes with 2 seasons Do we know what happened in the meeting between drivers and Netflix   I enjoyed the series but Im really really hoping that Geri Horner is boycotting S5  S6 I had to FF through so much Country Life footage last season No surprises but christ they need to step up the content quality Oh no Its getting worse each season I think that they should do a second Netflix show that’s more serious DTS is a great hook but there’s room for more content   It would be really cool if they could do a deep dive and follow one time for a whole year By the 6th season all the drivers will not want to be featured so it’s going to be all actors pretending to be the drivers with 100 made up storyline’s And another 2 seasons of manipulative pictures of F1 Cant wait to not watch Here’s to hoping they stop with the fabricated bullshit when they have enough content to produce a good series with the drama they already have And less Susie Wolff please it’s Drive to Survive not Manage to Survive Still dont understand why we need more fake drama in newer seasons if its mainly to attract new fans Are they gonna start the show from Season 5 As someone who doesnt give a fuck about this show let me just do my old man moaning    Why the fuck am I getting a BREAKING NEWS push notification on my Formula One racing app to tell me some Netflix show is coming back for another two seasons   Ugh Another thread of copy and pasted comments in every Netflix thread Like an actual game of Reddit bingo   I’ve liked every season enough they don’t owe me anything The show is what it is if you don’t like the format then stop watching Just realised if they continue down the route of overdramatisation they are probably going to use Landos sarcastic comments in some stupid convoluted way Should set the record straight on how the powers that be feel about the series Lot of people were using vague reports to insinuate that the series was unpopular and done for  DTS has been an overwhelmingly positive thing for the sport and for the smaller teams and lesser known drivers in particular If you watch the episodes of a single topic from all seasons back to back the ones with Gasly Gunther Haas Cyril and Ricciardo really stand out as amazing pieces of work  Im really looking forward to the future seasons Hope they make more time for Williams Alfa and the shenanigans at Aston Martin Hope it documents the races a bit more and the way it sways from race to race rather than make up rivalries and force things on us Don’t mind the BTS stuff if it actually includes more stuff about the car and ermmm the racing aspect Season 4 was average given the season was crazy Original Res Photo Needs a box for cutting away from the on track action to look at some clueless celebrities in a teams garage I like these but sad no rain related space I dont like how many squares are based on final race results All the pre and midrace squares more interesting If someone has too many squares based on final results theres no point playing Here is the link to the prediction competition Sad no Latifi crash at turn 16 My prediction From all the preweekend talk you could have “Fake Water” as the free space them showing the yacht party with the fake water on tv  miami puns Column 3 is looking good The pitlane chicane looks like its asking for trouble mediums are pretty decent most races VSCs have been pretty common and I favour Vettel as a driver over Stroll   Also poor Latifi and Sainz they just cant catch a break   All the Best  Welsh Dragon That was informative Huh I didnt realize the adjustment guns were designed to only rotate a predetermined amount but it makes sense  I wonder if they have a setting on them where they can add more if the gun jumps out of the head or if the guns are smart enough to not turn when there isnt a load This is super interesting Are there any other teams or maybe drivers on tiktok Would love this kind of content on my feed Aston has a very good social media presence for their behind the scenes stuff Not a fan of the team but I’m subscribed to their YouTube channel for all of the videos they put out Great share rspecializedtools I really do love the behind the scenes looks that TikTok has brought us It’s stuff that even 5 years ago would have been invisible to the average viewer just because nobody thought to cover it I need a lot more content like this The irony of tiktok a platform filled with teenagers and kids being where F1 teams showcase this kind of technical stuff is really funny I always wonder what they meant by 1 and 2 etc for wings Like is it cm Mm Or just whatever unit they use And can they go 05 maybe The changes don’t look too drastic I’m curious as to how that small angle affects the aero load on the FW Gif won’t open Commenting to find it later I have never wanted Tiktok before and now suddenly I discover I need it damn you Aston martin and your super cool informative clip That was cool as fook But Im pretty sure during race pit stops andor Indycar they use something akin to an allen wrench Great video except that tic tok thing at the end Cant they just get Max there to bend it a bit The first and last step are missing  First ask permission from Lawrence Stroll and at the end have the correction approved by Lawrence Stroll This special tool  A Bit driver     F1 you are cool but youre not building the iron man suit or performing magic lol  We know what a bit driver is  Most of us even have one in the garage showing a 403 error to me anyone got a mirror link Its crazy how much more hype he gets over someone like Palou who won Indy last year and is leading this year Lot of work to do if he wants to reach F1 Is he quick No doubt but hes also erratic and prone to unforced errors Nashville 2021 Long Beach 2022 Barber 2022 etc If he can consistently unlock his speed without mistakes hes got a chance but not many drivers can Colton is great but hes got some real early 2018 Verstappen vibes about him Id say Pato OWard is a better candidate for a potential seat at McLaren but then again if its an American they are specifically looking for Original Res Photo Wonder why he’s not in the car for a practice session this weekend O’ward is a better driver IMO So much hype for someone whos still learning to keep his shit together when racing for big points Herta is an awesome driver and talent dont get me wrong but hes still a bit far from being a nice suit for McLaren in the near future Id love to see him in F1 but Id also love for him to first get more consistent in Indycar hes such a 2019 Charles Leclerc right now mega fast but error prone and hotheaded This mans rapid and needs to replace Ricciardo once his contract runs down McLaren are disappointed with how Ricciardo performed last season citing they dont pay him a large contract to be underperforming The team is firmly centred around Lando Norris a delighted Zak Brown exclaims He should get SL first to think about F1 Plus without at least one season in F2 I do not see his potential F1 time as a success story Stop trying to make Colton Herta happen it’s not going to happen The grid is really young I dont think itll be anything easy to get anyone much less him a seat If his  somehow turns out to be 45 I can think of 2 major companies that would throw money at his team  Move over Heinekenthe Las Vegas F1 title sponsor is Let’s not rush a US driver into a seat due to the growth in the US Flat Brim helmet How to spot a Dutch person 101  Not wearing a helmet when cycling Original Res Photo Going out for a rip to scout the track Better slam the stem Do we really need to post every single tweet on the subreddit Why is this something worthy of posting  by bike  This puzzles confuses and enrages the American Yes and Lewis has just woken up and took shit deleted Not worth posting tbh What does BAME stand for This is always controversial on one hand yes there absolutely should be more of an emphasis inclusion of nonwhite youth but it never goes well when there’s mandatory spots for someone who has something that’s basically just cosmetic different about themself People will just say “oh he’s only here because he’s ” Is he sponsored by Winchester  Edit  NM his son is  No it shouldnt we should live in a socialist  meritocratic society where the background of some people arent tied to its past and were black people and some other minorities arent always in the backfoot compared to white people in the west tho  Asians dont count since they are on the same wealthy and educational level or higher than white people removed meanwhile the williams are trying to get rid of it lol Engineers working day and night to reduce weight of that merc  Design team its free real estate Because of the new NFT thingy car gonna be 0001 sec slower because that paint People do realise this is vinyl and not paint right Original Res Photo Funky I’m loving the Miami color schemes  I hope the Mclaren “leaked” special livery will be used A special livery  Oh god we are gonna beef for p19 and p20 then That will look good in victory lane Sunday For a team in as much strife as Mercedes it does seem a bit of a meme they are adding paintstickers while others are removing it Are the  really that important for a works team I was hoping for neon wheel covers but all right For those not wanting to open up Twitter  Norris posted a couple of pictures of his helmet for Miami his helmet is a basketball  Mercedes has photoshopped his helmet to replace the basketball in an imagine of Jordan dunking One of the replies was really good Original Res Photo Slam dunk  Do what you want with those words Merc admin do be killing it lately Its an upside down Alligator I am just saying That 3rd DRS zone looks really short It’ll be interesting to see if it’s long enough to give some good overtakes So is there any team that favors this circuit Long straight looks like redbull power train Are the minisector lengths determined by the amount of time it takes to complete them Honestly looks like it could be a cool layout Via Adam Cooper    Some small tweaks from the FIA to the Miami DRS zones even before the cars have run Detection 1 is 7m later D2 is 3m earlier and D3 is 4m earlier Meanwhile Activation 1 is 37m earlier Feels a bit weird having the first two DRS detection and activation points on the same straight given the corners preceding them are the very sort where the trailing car will lose time Just before T78 and just after T13 feels like it would work better from a racing perspective I swear the track is rotated differently on every map I see Why is the corner in MS04 not a corner but the straight on MS09 have a corner 9 I always wondered how circuit length is determined exactly My guesses were centerline length or average of inner and outer white line length Guess they use the centerline I’ll save this pic handy to know for when I’m following the mini sectors on the timing app This circuit actually looks really cool Id love to see elevation changes but some of the curves are a real classic design DRS 12 could be huge for someone Turn 10 is gonna be flat out and I can’t understand why you would even call that a turn Why doesnt the map have the pitlane  Youd think that an FIA map would have something that important lol New Circuit Map     Link to official FIA Document     Edit For reference heres the old circuit map Its nice that the DRS detection points are all after a corner rather than before so you cant play DRS games on the brakes in the same way they did in Jeddah for example as youll lose out on the longer flat out sections after the detection points So theyre longer   why now Im scared of too easy overtakes even more Will be changed again if it doesnt help Toto enough Why is F1 making DRS zones in to gimmicks Two zones is fine but for some reason they are adding more and more to make artificial overtakes and drama Speaks to the failure of these new regs Rulemakers were saying DRS could well be eliminated with the new ruleset no DRS on the showcars for a reason right Instead DRS is more than ever before don’t fall for the nonsense folks All for the spectacle I guess Miami needs to be an overtake fest These DRS zones especially between 911 and 1617 seem way too powerful I do feel the corner being so much more open visually on the inside with the wall moved back will encourage some to send it          Its a lot less intimidating The last 5 cars are quite musical E A A E Doubt they lift still kinda like it Honestly if I hadn’t been reading about the renovations I doubt I would have even noticed anything was different aside from the bigass grandstands of course Friendly reminders from 2021 of why changes are necessary     I’m drooling I doubt they will lift in a Formula 1 car but still the new look to the Radillion corner is very good its got the same fearsome character as it was before but with a Stand looking down onto the corner Those gotta be the best grandstand seats ever right I suppose it is a little bit different Lol 😂 it’s the same kinda Even the GT3s look fast af F1 needs some more static camera angles like this Not those 400 too far zoomed in tracking shots I could watch that shit all day I remember the good old days Find somoene that looks at you like Toto looks at ChristianMax Make sure Guenther and Kevin don’t drink too much or stuff might get fook smashed everywhere Are opening parties something thats done for every tracks first race weekend or is this just cuz its Miami Never knew this was a thing before a race weekend What u doing step Fred Seb looks slouchy lol Im actually surprised so many poster designs went with vaporwavesynthwave I was hoping more of the posters took an interest in art deco architecture Cuban influences or even pastel beach scenes Hell nobody even did a proper Miami Vice throwback lol The clichés just keep on coming Was hoping for checo firing off an m16 and max doing a line off the front wing runixporn has better vaporwave art than this I definitely like the way they have gone with the poster synthwave I believe but still its really nice This one is nice  Haas still wins no questions asked everyone complaining about the same theme from all the teams  but Im loving it Keep em coming     I wish teams did more oneoffs throughout the season than they already do Especially with helmets  some of them seem so bland for the season and only get creative in the oneoffs Love the synthwave vibe Does anyone know if you can buy these somewhere Im excited for the inevitable comparison video that shows how inaccurate the Codies version is They have managed to create a track before it was built yet they still havent managed to completely rebuilt Spa Gonna look so realistic with porposing keep landos head away from zhou This is kind of hilarious I like the basic design and lack of sponsors Love the touch of his signature as the commissioner It must be weird going to hold this helmet expecting to feel the grippy leathery texture of a basketball and instead feeling the cold slick texture of bare carbon fibre Love that he did something other than the neon pink and palm trees that everyone else is doing Goofiest helmet design yet I love it This is so cool it’s almost stupid Props to Mclaren as well for giving that much artistic freedom This is a really cool concept and design Is there a reason for this though Is Lando a huge basketball fan Or cross promotion with nba Finally an original design If lando gets another podium and all the mechanics congratulate him by tapping on his helmet during parc ferme its essential a basketball game Man is gonna look like a GTA character They should paint the T cam into MJ’s palm so it’ll look like he’s bouncing a basketball down the main straight Its genuinely so awesome I hope he raffles it away like he did his Monaco helmet Wow thats good nice to see a big difference in helmet designs from normal Like it used to be That is slightly insane Damn it looks like real ball That’s hideous I love it so much Went from 🥎 to 🏀 It looks so real The Halloween pumpkin helmet is totally happening irl soon right Right  Edit Missing word helmet Love Lando for this I can smell this helmet through the internet WINNER   Really thats awesome and will look great in the orange McLaren Also many drivers got the pinkblue on their helmets so this one really standsout A Lando Superb design and a brilliant idea Really cool This is sick I love when drivers do full concept special helmets like Dany Riccs football helmet design for Austin a couple years back instead of just adjusting the color scheme with a few design tweaks   This fits so well with the McLaren color scheme as well wow well done I’m overwhelmed with different emotions I dont know if this is my favourite this weekend but it is the most memorable This is perfect Especially with the Heat up 20 in the series Okay I am impressed with Lando for going for that helmet design that is so awesome This is so smart I love it Cooooool would definitely grab a miniature of this if one is ever made can i ask a silly question does this come out of the teams annual budget I think is the most creative helmet design that Ive ever seen Looks great best helmet this year Aiyooo that’s fucking awesome This is cool AF Love it Thats one of the coolest helmets Ive ever seen Love it This is the best and funniest helmet design I think I’ve ever seen Im not normally one to comment on another mans helmet but that my friends is stellar I fuck with this It was a tad jarring at first but the more I looked at it the more I liked it   Really different and really cool Baller Insanity Wow that is amazing really perfect Pretty cool how the lines are reminiscent of his usual design one of the best helmet design right now for me i couldnt believe it at first it looked like they actually attached the leather of a basketball to the helmet WOW This is legitimately one of the best helmet designs Ive ever seen This makes me very uncomfortable I mean…this is sick I love his helmets This one is great Just like the pizza helmet Nailed it Such a simple idea rATBGE Go Heat Might be my all time Favorite design McLaren is lucky there’s porpoising otherwise they’d be penalized for traveling Isnt someone at McLaren a part owner of the Phx Suns or something like that There in the playoffs right now so maybe thats y he has a basketball helmet Lmfao just wait til we see hes got a custom race suit too   I hate this with ball my heart Not sure if intentional but a cool touch I noticed is how the seams of the basketball design is similar to the blue lines of his regular helmet The rnba  rformula1 crossover we all need Hahahawtf What a bizarre idea — and its freakishly well executed Me”Lando Norris will never be ballin’”  Lando Norris Brooooooooooooooooo this is absolutely caked in cool OK that is legitimately the best racing helmet Ive ever seen I kneel Sick Nah this is goated My God it’s… it’s… beautiful 😢 That couldve very easily looked like shit but its so painstakingly accurate and detailed that I think it works I like it a lot Much better than the boring 80s neon miami vice GTA style ones This wouldn’t have made sense if the race is in Seattle rTIHI Haha this is so much rATBGE rATBGE Idk this is like rATBGE material to me it just seems wrong 🤣you need a better picture for the first one  I literally thought it was a basketball with visors tape to it I like it It is not like basketball is something exclusive from Miami but at least is not another vaporwave design and it is not crowded with Spam like the one from my man Alonso Good old OurLando Florida Would make a lot more sense for a race in Indy but pretty cool Wearing a basketball helmet outside of a Football stadium is certainly a choice how many guys gonna hit landos head like it was a ball Thats a nice football Ironically being held around the football stadium nowhere near the Miami Heat or basketballs of any kind kind of cool but kind of ugly lol Does the world think of Miami as a basketball town Genuine question and kind of hilarious if so Why though rATBGE And he answered super bowl instead of NBA finals clincher court side It disturbs me how realistic this is Id hate going to touch it and it feeling smooth and hard not bumpy with some give We gotta see Danny Ric’s but I think it’s safe to say Lando wins the helmet race It’s so cool… but it bothers me sooooooo much that the panels are wrong Ball is life Cant say Im a fan of this one Landos Helmet  Max doesnt need one He just shaves his head bald and paints it to look like a football helmet Checo one the other hand will put a helmet around his helmet because hes scared But Max isnt He doesnt fear anyone or anything for that matter  Helmut Marko probably I like the idea but I dont like how it looks Hes gone from tennis ball to basket ball  This is unbelievably cool though goddamn This has to be the sickest helmet design I’ve seen in a long time Ok this is actually one of my favourite helmet designs from him ever This is spot on This is so cool lmaoo I don’t really like it but it’s definitely very well done rATBGE Aweful taste but great execution I hope everyone on the grid calls him “Basketball Head” all weekend a la Hey Arnold Hot damn thats a good lookin lid Its revolting Well done Didnt he answer Superbowl over NBA finals in the would you rather video Thats originaland pure  Good thing we can still have this kind of design for once without 5000 sponsors desecrating the design philosophy or someone complaining about his trypophobia or something The ugliest helmet Ive ever seen kinda hilarious though as an American i love that F1 drivers come to America just to fucking let loose and do all the goofy things Wow Very nice Amazing Basketball sucks 57 Perfect score my god it’s hideous Ew lmao Everything about this GP is cringeworthy Ready to score a three pointer race It triggers my trypophobia I hate it I like it ratbge Possibly the coolest and most original design I’ve seen Will definitely stand out Great job to the artistdesigner The least aerodynamic helmet on the grid Shouldve saved the design for one of the mercedes or ferrari drivers Can just imagine them bouncing up and down the straight lol I wanna dribble it this looks amazing rATBGE  EDIT Subbed in the wrong direction Coming from the guy who doesnt know what city the Lakers play for lmaoo FUGLY I hate it Lando Magic ummm no horrible Epic And yet Gasly met MJ Lame Why is the lamest sport in America invading F1 This is stupid…I said it ducks   Least fav of the weekend But concept is admittedly a little cool My eyes Its at a football stadium WHAT Does it actually have the raised bumps It looks like it with the way the light is reflecting on some of those pics It looks like when you mess up the air bladder in the ball lol I’m not sure if I absolute hate or absolutely love this It’s definitely one or the other Whole grid is going to have a special helmet at this point lol 🏀 Bro no fucking way lmao I can feel it with my eyes I doubt this is why Lando went for this particular design but the NBA playoffs are happening now and ESPNABC has a big chunk of the broadcast rights and they will be airing the race so it works as a crosspromotion for Disney as well which I’m sure they’ll mention and appreciate Damn that’s astrometric that texturing tho… That is fucking awesome The detail is incredible Blursed That looks really cool I think Looks like a real ball Amazing Someone needs to put this on tradingpaints immediately Do you think he likes basketball This is truly awful and I love it Le Mau this is actually disgusting but its done so well lmao Lewis and Charles should be wearing it boing boing boing I had no clue they got helmets for specific grand prix I just thought they used the same one New meaning for bouncing on the track Bruh Noooo way Should have put the Miami Heat logo on it LETS GO HEAT Pretty sweet helmet but let the porpoising begin 😂 I read the first two words quickly as Nandos The colour of the helmet doesn’t help nor the texture I think maybe I should lay off the chicken for a while I love Lando  this helmet is awesome but the child in me is hoping Danny Ric takes a marker  writes ‘END’ next to the giant bell logo on the back kind of cool but kind of ugly lol Whoever painted it did a phenomenal job the texture looks so realistic All that work and money for him to DNF Interesting to not show the front lol My helmet has a sticker on it saying that I cant paint it or add any stickers to it or it will no longer be effective How TF did they do this was it tested at all Bruh All fun and games until instincts take over and Ricciardo tries to Dunk Landos head He wins the Best Helmet Ever award Thats one of the coolest helmet design Ive ever seen Suns in 4 Straight 🔥 This is awesome MOVE IT BASKETBALL HEAD This is my favourite helmet ever I like how they made it look bumby without it actually being bumby I wish it was bumpy though lerbonjanes u like what u see Some people in the comments who dont think this is cool What is cool to you I don’t understand how this relates to Miami It’s not really a basketball city The Miami Heat have had empty seats all throughout the playoffs… thats fuckin rad That as the kids say is dope Friking awesome Move it football head No Miami Heat logo Is there any backstory of why its a basketball themed Head like a fuckin orange Thats beautiful My favorite helmet I’ve seen so far Whats that plastic thing on the back of the helmet for Best helmet so far I love it so cool Now this is next level  Can’t believe it’s right in my backyard and can’t go  Drivers will do anything to get a signature from MJ tbh I would do the same Heat culture baby I mean that’s incredible This is just good moneysaving by McLaren Recycle and reuse Outfuckingstanding This is one of the most completely random helmet designs of all time and Im here for it It was designed by a guy called MDM Designs you should check out their Facebook he does quite a few drivers designs Baller If it was a videogame helmet paintjob you could change  this would be the annoying one developers give everyone for free as an incentive to buy better ones for money NBA JAAAAAAAM  Lando confirmed for the remakeif it ever happens Lmao “genuine leather” Lets go Heat rtrypophobia WILSOOOONNN Basketball helmet at a football stadium 🤣 cant blame him though the heat actually win Albon trying to explain Bear Grylls I want a whole video of people explaining shit to Charles after seeing people explain smoothchunky peanut butter and Bear Gryllis to him 😂 i can almost guarantee it was lando with the boom mic Crofty in the background blagging a free Williams shirt😂😂 This is one of the best videos I’ve seen F1 put out recently Really enjoyed it 19 Drivers  Miami is great Im enjoying the golfbasketballbaseballfootball   Max  its all about the race yeah Absolutely love this format  It’s informal but it doesn’t feel forced to me The drivers seem chill spontaneous… not easy with a camera in their face and knowing it will be shown to the world lol   Sidenote    Change my view or not  Based on looks Charles is the most beautiful driver in the history of F1 My fav bits are drivers greeting their exbosses i know its such a small thing but still love to see it nonetheless SebFranz GeorgeJost CarlosZak Of course Yuki talks about the food The man lives for it My pride hearing Charles say in America you feel like anything is possible ‘MURICA One of the funniest Videos F1 has done for a while Max really is all about the racing Russell looks like the most generic dude on the planet Look up man in the dictionary and see the picture If you look closely Lewis is actually trying to push against it and drown the W13 in the sea The cars fucked perspective makes it difficult for me to appreciate the rest of the poster I really like the paintbrush strokes in the sky though lewis with the initial d pose Crockett and Tubs Just putting this out there  Mercedes produced shit posters in the past 4 races and their results were equally poor  Now there are news about car upgrades in miami and this poster actually looks decent  Mercedes 1  2 God Souria really knocks it out of the park with these Im so glad to see shes getting recognition and work in the industry  If anyone wants to see more of her work you can find her soudraws on twitter  Russell looks like the safety instructions card guy onboard much about any airline has Some Miami Vice vibes Nicely drawn poster the water looks exactly as it does in the marina Looks like the car is up on an invisible front jack in no other team posters 2022 budget restrictions scream so loud Tbh it looks stuffy and kinda lame compared to the others HAMs face in this poster has that Ah shit here we go again vibe I wonder who the artist is because that is really good This poster is brilliant Just absoloutely amazing Hopefully their car is as good as their poster Ah a poster to match the car they produced So bad My brain hurts when I look at the rear right and front right And theres a palm tree on the sea oh wait it wasnt a sea right still Nice looking poster  Feel like this is what Alpha Tauri wanted theirs to be lol I like the art style of it Love the pre race posters the teams do They are trying Everything is so bad with Merc this year Haas did it first and better Could someone better in Photoshop than me please add some dolphins jumping in the water  Edit maybe also take out that monster palm tree out in the ocean You can literally see how excited they are to drive the W13 from their faces Russell has Frank Grimes energy The car actually looks like its bouncing Im impressed Wow they totally got Bottas looking wrong Again George Russell as the front figure of the poster Whats going on here Its definitely the right move to make from the FIA to show that it is in support of the cause to provide as much help as possible to get Ukraine fully rebuilt after this horrific stuff is over Original Res Photo  FIA Statement removed Ah finally something creative and sans blue purple Bottas and Zhou are wearing the same suits as James Crockett and Riccardo Tubbs on the poster of the original Miami Vice TV show A refreshing design after seeing all the vaporwave bluepink posters and promos for the last few weeks   Alfa always delivers with these same as Ferrari TIL Miami has a flag Glad to see the Indian Grand Prix return Idk its miami flag or indian flag These motherfuckers dont miss Biiiig Tintin vibes in this one Zhou and Bottas look so good in this art style miamindia Alfa Romeo always set a high bar for a poster and this is just amazing definitely got a tintin vibe about it with the art direction of the drivers This is a wholesome poster  It makes me think that Bottas  Zhou have bought a house and are about to settle down together Alfa Romeo posters one of the greatest really wish I could buy them   It looks like we might have gotten a sneak peak at Bottas helmet for the weekend too Why does VB look like an adult Caillou 🤣 Random indian flag is random     edit  I lived in south florida for nearly 2 decades and had no idea that miami had a flag or what it looked like Fun fact Miami’s flag is older than India’s flag 1933 and 1947 respectively Alfa nailing the poster game again Is the Indian gp coming back Looks like a tintin special closest well ever get to an Indian Grand Prix now I guess Damn this one is really great The better poster for Miami GP I was wondering why theres an Indian flag🇮🇳 there then I saw the palm tree  Never knew that Miami has its own flag Bottas looks like Tintin Tintin I scrolled past thinking thats the Indian flag Thats a beautiful poster they win this round Love the references to Miami Vice Don Bottas D At first I was thinking what the fuck does the Indian flag have to do with Miami Alfa aesthetic is just always on point I dont understand the Indian Flag s What is the other flag Looking almost like the Indian National Flag This just has a lovely vibe to it They put a drop shadow on GRAND PRIX but forgot it on MIAMI Tintin Goes to Miami Really thought that was the Indian flag for a second until I payed closer attention and looked up Miami flag All I can see with Bottas outfit is Robin Williams in The Birdcage Am I the only one who sees a TinTin style going on With how much they want the track to be Monaco its pretty ironic that their flag is basically just Indias There you go The real Kings of poster design shows the way once again Enough of the Miami Vice inspired posters Ugh The roaring 2020’s That’s raw Whats up with all the custom designed stuff for this race Its it because the track is new outer is this gonna happen every year Thought this was Last Shadow Puppets fan art for a moment TinTin It looks like Dale Gribble as Bottas Got Confused for a second thinking that was an incorrect representation of the Indian Flag Google told me thats Miami city Flag Reminds me of the movie the birdcage lol   Is that the couple from the birdcage Is that Bobby Hill This reminds me of the poster with the weird butt Why doesn’t this sub put as much effort into art with all the other tracks lol Lovin it tho Classiest of them all What have they done to Bottas nice to see a poster styled from before the cocaine days People were hating on the alfa livery but it looks really good even when its not lined up My favorite for shure Thought it was the Indian flag for a quick second Work by Jalcalara Theyve done several Alfa posters previously in this gorgeous ligne claire style Wtf indian fags whata f Love this style Very Tintinesque Buddh international autodrome Alfa Romeo designers don’t miss do they At least someone’s graphic designer is sticking to the non crypto design scheme Okay it is a comic in a country with a rich comic book history Not an I the only one who thinks that the style is more FrancoBelgian comic than American I get strong Tintin vibes here  But looks really nice Such a beautiful poster I wish Manor had managed to hold on they always did good work Man those clothes…I’m in Florida and this morning humidity at my house hit 90 and it’s 95 degrees outside right now This is giving me some real Tintin vibes I love it Tintins adventure at the Miami Grand Prix   Credit As a general rule see full rules a standalone Discussion post should   be of interest to the

OP  If not be sure to look for the Daily Discussion rformula1s daily open question thread which is perfect for asking any and all questions about this sport  Thank you for your cooperation and enjoy the discussion   I am a bot and this action was performed automatically Please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorformula1 if you have any questions or concerns I don’t think people really appreciate how difficult producing a live event for television is when the “most important thing right now” is constantly unclear in contrast to football or baseball or basketball where the ball is always the top priority No offense but this post kinda screams of “I don’t really know what I’m talking about but I’m going to tell people how to do it anyway”  I don’t think “F1 producer” is a real job overarching job that involves the same people inrace and in this preevent and creating the graphics And for the intro event I’m sure there were some time constraints in place that they had to adhere to   Obviously you’re still free to have your opinion and some of your points are valid but I think there’s a lot of confusion on what some of these people do and don’t do The intro party was just that an introduction Im not sure why you expected teams to be interviewed or anything like that To be honest they really should have just put the teams out without having them make a statement which would have made the whole thing cleaner The only real issue I had with it was a clear lack of direction  Seemed like Crofty had to steer the ship like an MC which was pretty weird for this kind of event   Race broadcast complaints are just silly honestly The races are live and the people broadcasting can only see so much from their angles They dont always know when theres an ontrack battle going on When a decision is made to cut to replay or change angles its generally too late to cut to something else I couldn’t enjoy it because they kept rushing everyone in and out making it VERY obvious that they were under very strict time restraints  My guess is the time restraints had to do with wanting a nighttime vibe without having a latenight noise permit  like Zak Brown which was the only American on the stage   Sad Otmar noises I think the replays of the start have become such a thing because recent history has shown the race is won or lost on the start Hopefully as the racing on track gets better and cars can now follow more closely and even pass the broadcast will adapt to that and show less start replays You can also replace F1 producers with Fans  Fans sometimes don’t understand what the fans actually want and would benefit from the most  Not saying you are wrong but fans make the stupidest requests most of the time Quite odd how you portray your own personal opinion as what the fans want Youre not speaking for everyone else with these arguments so dont act like you are I am a fan too and i prefer the broadcast to stay like it is F1 should just let fans run everything Im sure it would be great What You didnt enjoy looking at Sainz blank stare instead of watching Leclerc rejoining the track after Norris last race Not just the start replays what drives me through the wall is the need to show the crowds reacting to a drivers battle over the actual action on track I dont want to watch the crowds and miss the action Im not asking for much An opening ceremony or launch party for a race event is ridiculously over the top and why a lot of people were cringing when Vegas was announced That’s going to be so much worse a level of cheese on a grand scale I can’t wait for Liberty to sell up when they’ve milked the sport for all it’s worth Completely agree about ridiculous start replays when there are still opening lap battles going on I can understand that midrace sometimes the most interesting moment is missed but it should still be done better as well I think that live timing with laps and sectors should be either free or very inexpensive  Data access is big for f1 fans who stick around Finally more wide shots rather than tracking cars from very close which removes the sensation of speed Its not a good look when amateur videos from smartphones provide better viewing than professional broadcast Oh and same goes for filtered flybuzzing car engine sound Understanding a fans perspective and adhering to it is one area the sport really needs to learn in order to grow The media that covers F1 is very entrenched in the sport they have been around for decades Because of this often without realizing I think they carry the exclusivity and elitism the sports history is entrenched with F1 under its previous management viewed themselves as an elite rich prosperous group and marketed themselves to that select few As the world has become more digital there is a switch in where people go to get there sports coverage Think barstool vs espn   I think part of F1s hesitancy in embracing this change is they very much like to control the narrative I dont know the solution because for them as an entity there are extreme benefits to being able to control the narrative or the story You better get ready for 60 of the race to be fan crowd shots this weekend Tv director has been shocking for a while imo Most over in rindycar suggest Penske has been eyeing up an endurance race since he bought IMS Could also just be a courtesy visit I would love it if F1 came back to Indy I attended a few races back in the early 2000’s when they were there and would love to go back with my wife for a race she’s only interested in F1 no other racing unfortunately Is he Penske material The scenes if the US gets a fourth race at Indy The AntiAmerican squad gonna have to be on suicide watch Before the comments flood in F1 isn’t and has no reason to go to Indy In 2020 penske said he was interested in f1 but that no serious talks were happening this was back when a fia official went to see the indianapolis motor speedway facilities Im going to assume the same situation remains neither penske nor f1 is interested i guess penske is bussy with Indycar and theres not that much money for f1 in indiana Idk i for one would hope indy comes back eventually Why wouldnt the head of the FIA go see the head of IndyCar and the most famous circuit in the US Original Res Photos  Photo  Photo 2  Photo 3 COTA indy and long beach would be the ideal 3 USA race calendar F1 Indy 500 just for the Lols Penske has little to no interest in hosting F1 He could literally be talking about anything 4th US race in 2023 confirmed “You like money”  “Fuck yeah” So he only sometimes wears a thawb I went to the miami eprix years ago formula e and got grandstand seats   Between the track and my grandstand were a line of trees so i could briefly see the cars zip down the straight between the trees for maybe a quarter second   I wound up leaving my more expensive seat and watching the race from the general admission area      Karun Chandhock spun right in front of me and maybe 15 feet apart we shared awkward eye contact Its the ability to Instagram it is what youre paying for Honestly 1000 is pretty cheap by Miami GP standards considering cheapest grandstands were 800 so I’m not surprised You are basically paying for the experience of being somewhere near an F1 car while getting a tan and drinking beer Brazil living the dream  150 for 3 days  25 beer  2 beverages Ya but when are you ever going to feel the sand between your toes at an F1 race 😂 You think they care Hint miami wasnt chosen because of its die hard fans You’re paying for social media clout not to see the race Uh youd probably stand up for the actual race Isnt it hard to judge without a view thats actually from the seats Like they care They are there for the sand booze and bc they heard thats the place to be in Miami this wknd lol If you tell them the race is between the safety and medical car they will believe it lol Just like the thousands of people who travel to Coachella just for vibes you bet your ass that the people who forked out 1000 for these beach chairs aren’t gonna care much about the racing Who cares Most people there dont even know how F1 works  Its all about famous and rich people getting that instagram post with some champagne and networking From what I remember there isnt a tv in this area The opposite side is surrounded by stands I think they will have to watch it on a tv in the HardRock club Its not about seeing the cars Its about being there and taking Instagram stories If you sit at Rascas or on your yacht in Monaco you cant see the cars very well either Its about showing off Hear the race live but watch it on TV from your beach chair still seems not bad These people probably arent there to see the cars anyway Most of the people probably aren’t going there for the race anyway The most surprising part of this post to me is that those seats are only 1000 F1 could have had this race at the Daytona or HomesteadMiami road course God forbid people pay to actually watch a race and not just flex on the poors Wait theres a race Everything about consuming this race in person is a total shit show   It leaves me concerned for the Vegas GP Am I the only one thinking there isn’t an actual safety Barrier for the beach side Did they not think of elevating it This is making the mistake of assuming the people who paid to be in this section are there for the race  At this point Im just going to stop bitching and embrace the suck Wouldnt they be able to just stand up and be basically trackside I dont understand all the hate Great planning lol In Austria general admission tickets for the whole weekend are 110€ and you can literally see  half the track from there Theres cars Only in Miami lol I imagine theyll be up against the fence The people buying 1000 “beach” seats aren’t there to see the race The race is just the back drop to this particular social event for them Its not a place to see the race but to be seen at the race How will they not be able to see the car if the track is right beside them Cant they just  stand up during the actual race The prices for the race are ridiculous Those are being seen not to actually see the race My first race 2000 bought GA seat was 40 feet from the cars at 200MPH with perfect view Oh yeah ticket was 30 Ahh the good ole days cant believe i just said that Ive never felt the urge to go watch a GP live Extreme cases like this aside wont you just get a better view of things at home its not about the money its about sending a message Oh you think people whom book those seats are there to see the cars But those insta photos tho 🤦 Why do people think anyone paying 1000 for hospitality tickets are going to watch the race on the track  They will watch it on a TV at the bar If they watch it at all Circuit de Barcelona  GA ticket £140  Return flight  hotel £380 5 night   Yes please  😎😎😎 I can sense some Fyre festival vibes for those seats 😂 Most people going to this event arnt there to see the cars Imagine paying 1000 and see a wall But the people who pay 1000 for F1 probably dont even car for the F1 they will be in the VIP area and drinking champagner and eating during the race anyway  While I am sitting at the track 247 Friday to Sunday in Spielberg with my 100€ ticket to see F3 F2 and Porsche and of course F1 This year it is over 100€ for the first time lets hope thats real sand But youre missing the point  everyone can see YOU 😎💰💸 Ive been to 3 races and you can barely see any cars at any track Having lived in Miami for 4 years I can say this whole track and event is the epitome of Miami  Flashy overpriced likely sub par quality Welcome to Miamithey dont care about the race its about showing off you paid for the seats I live in Miami its the most fake city I have ever seen cant wait to get back out Games gone no that would have to be risen for 23 meters but for that the safetyfence is to low Thank God COTA is a proper race course There are multiple giant screens on track     Lets be clear The best way to view the actual GP is in front of your TV or your PC if you are using F1 TV account  This is an experience you are next to F1 cars theres an electric mood beer food you name it its redicolus its a bad fake beach and it would be ears killer Im torn I want good racing because I will watching at home But all this fake lifestyle in the middle of a parking lot is making me sick and I dont want F1 returning and doing this all over again Looks like a good spot to nap and have a beer Is this next to the fake water Thatll complete the vibe All these people will be watching the race on a giant screen somewhere nearby The actual race is for ambiance deleted Why would I want to seat on sand if theres no beach Like sand is the bad thing about going to the beach which is what people who cant afford a swimming pool do I thougt the yachts on fake water already didnt make much sense but this is another level HardRock sucks This was a problem when Singapore hosted there first race So much better off booking a high rise room for the weekend and watching from there Miami GP taking inspiration from Fyre Im sure  things like this will get sorted for next year at least Theyre obviously a bit rushed this year This shit is turning into the new Fyre Festival Its laughable If it is this fake I can’t imagine what Vegas will be like How can you fuck up so badly lol Yeah not many people attending the Miami gp care about f1 That’s ok the people buying those seats aren’t interested in the cars or racing anyway Man as a new American F1 fan it really is a smack to the face I don’t understand how F1 is expected to grow if they keep catering to a wealthier fanbase Do I like more races coming to the US Hell yeah Do I like that two of them are now going to be in super tourist spots that the average Joe will struggle to afford Hell no Does F1 as an organization want to grow or are they content with getting money from the rich deleted As an American I’m already hating this GP There is a second floor in the beachclub If that cost more I dont know Then again its not much to slag Was at Imola and they really dont do all they can either to ensure a good viewing experience  F1 should really work with all the tracks a but over the next years to try improve it Is the sand real at least Can’t you just walk around and go watch somewhere else like at football games I always go to the fan zone party areas and watch from standing bar area Nobody buying those seats cares what they’re able to see only that they will be seen Mrbeast new video place lmao the target customer are the celebs who barely give a fuck about the race anyway so it works out gonna sell out either way most likely wont be able to see cars  Oh they will when Carlos finds his way to the closest thing to gravel that this track has Those seats are ment to be sold to influencers not real racing fans Those seats are to be seen in not to see from Something that caught my attention when Esfand the twitch streamer went to COTA was how many people didnt come from racing rather they came for the experience Cool people vibes drinks and watch cars too   This is just an extension of attrack experience trying to attract that audience This is how influencer based marketing works see revolve fest Coachella for example Are we remotely surprised The race organizers only care how it looks on tv Same with the people sitting there They just want to be seen there You’re paying to share a space with beautiful rich people Good deal I suppose if you want followers They have places like this in Montreal too It’s not a Miami or US thing It’s all  and that’s fine Let those people enjoy that experience  I will say being on track level and close is pretty cool too It’s just a different way to experience the show Is the sand even real That’s why I always go in the back I know Indy is considered low brow and all but for 1000 I am taking my father to Indy 500 and sitting with a great view of the final turn and startfinish You could also toss in the hotel and rental car for FridayMonday and one of our fight tickets from Minneapolis in that 100000 I really hope it rains lol  Bring on the chaos Isn’t there a whole beech club  They can prolly watch from that deck I can’t wait for a rain to down pour on these seats… Are the races in Europe this ridiculously expensive That track and its design around it is pure chaos Cool spot but unless you’re on a high pedestal you’ll won’t be able to see shit Looks like they’ll see plenty And moreso than that they look like what’s on show for the grandstands when there’s no action I Those corners  That would be so awkward to me to have thousands looking across at a few dozen in those beach chairs lol The F1 snobbery on here is something else   If these seats are advertised as an up close and personal F1 experience and you cant see shit then that is bullshit dont assume it is just women with fake breasts here for a holiday and an Instagram photo   I would pay a premium for beach seats where I could watch the race with a good site line If that is what these people were expecting then this is really shitty for them and you all shouldnt be a bunch of cunts What am I missing Why won’t they be able to see over that wall This GP is a becoming a failure before it even starts I can see it now the youtube mini documentaries about the nightmare Miami GP of 2022 Fuuuuuck Miami They are there to be seen not to see the race Looks like theyll be able to see just fine People there dont watch the race anyway they just want to be seen I wouldnt worry about it the people that are going to spend tens of thousands for those stupid seats probably wont be able to tell you who Michael Schumacher or Ayrton Senna were either  Maybe theyll remember Nicky Louder from that movie Thor was in  Theyll be looking at their phones all race anyway They will taste and see sand  its crazy how theyre in Miami but those dumbasses couldnt get the race right next to the water  Meanwhile we have races in Monaco  So really was F1 just being cheap for MIA Lol wouldve been a cool opportunity to have cameras on the trackside barriers feeding to screens immediately behind  crudely making an invisible wall I can go to MidOhio and see the Indy race for like 60 The Miami race has just lost the plot Americans love overpriced sub par quality  let them have it in peace Better bring your own hyraulic ramp to see over the fence xD You can feel the speed Duh Bold of you to assume they care I get free tickets from some guy I know for the red bull ring every year He sponsors something or whatever No idea So many people are making out everybody who bought these tickets are there for social media likes People can be richer than average Joe and still have just a big of interest in F1 as average Joe It could be that they’re taking their partners are are keeping all parties happy It could just be that they like the idea of this Let people enjoy what they enjoy… Really cool I like it I feel like Zhou ended up being the perfect 2 driver for Alfa He has a very similar demeanor to Bottas A bit quiet but seemingly a happy guy Keeping his head down and just have great drives for his first season I keep putting money on him to get in the points Siiick Really starting to like zhou tbh That’s a nice helmet Wow I love this  Danny Ric vibes This is the one Starting to really like this kid Seems like he might have potential   Cool helmet too Like it alot Cool helmet good dude It has probably been said somewhere but why do all  drivers have a special Miami livery   Commercially interesting of course and it really looks like they were heavily influenced by a kind of blueprint of palm trees and happiness Everybody get up its time to slam now 🎶 my man included more basketball references than sponsor logos lol Why does he have a busted knock off bugs bunny cartoon Is it a logo in not familiar with That is one fucking sick lid man Gaat damn That is really a slick design vibrant and really pops out at you Aside from the playoffs being in full swing anyone know the deal with both Lando and Zhou having basketball features Dope  RIP Kobe What a great helmet design Zhou Hey can I put Lola Bunny on my helmet  Alfa We have Lola Bunny at home  The Lola Bunny at home They all kinda look the same Such a cool helmet and Im liking the basketball rabbit adding a nice cool touch Soo good The colors pop so well And the sponsor logos arent overbearing 🔥🔥 A Lisa Frank binder with stickers F1 Helmet Edition Does he sell them on scale Can someone tell me how hes holding the helmet on the first pic Is this guy a magician This is fucking sick Sweet design He actually put his Fursona on it The fucking mad lad Guys I think he likes basketball Love the space jam reference I like the “totally not basketball Bugs Bunny from space jam due to international copyright law” on the side nice touch How do I get a useable replica of this What does the Chinese word mean on the basketball part Very cool Maybe a bit cluttered but its a lovely departure from the typical racing helmet designs All this Miami stuff is going to severely damage my wallet With little dipshit and daddy gone Haas seems like an entertaining and marketable team  This is great news The idea is not ludicrous the company appears to have stability A 50 million or so marketing deal may bot be that outside their expansion plans and budgets    5his is definetly not a rich energy situation The KMAG effect   Looking into their company sounds like a pretty solid sponsorship Probably not gonna be life changing for Haas based on the size but who gives a fuck Glad to see Haas getting some new sponsorship Haas going to the moon With a name like Lunar I was so worried this was another crypto sponsorship Thankfully its an actual bank that provides actual products and services I’m sure this will work out So much positivity surrounding Haas at the moment Adding to that they have a very respectable package this year getting new sponsors on bord must have become a million times easier Huh They had their logo on the car at previous weekends already why they announce it just now Will it also be on F1TV With the announcement on sky I was hoping something in the US would pop up I’ll watch ESPN will broadcast live coverage of all qualifying and race sessions across their portfolio of channels including ESPN2 ESPN3 ESPNU and ESPNEWS  Very surprised ESPN is actually putting W series on their flagship stations My initial reaction was ok sure theyll just throw it on ESPN and make people pay to stream it Nice Ive always wanted to be able to watch W Series here Im in too  Good job Some great broadcasting deals for the W series lately Looks like more Magisterial Messi replays on BeIn Great news Excited to watch The only thing I see on the ESPN app right now is the Spanish language broadcast Hope they just haven’t gotten that squared away yet This is great news Anyone from this group have a good shot at F1 Fuck yes thank you Anything to support these women Yay I can’t for the life of me understand why F1 can’t seem to work it out for it to be on F1TV… seems a bit of a nobrainer Are there pictures of the cocaine chicane  Look at all the shadows on the road The surface doesn’t look flat at all Can’t wait to see HAM bobblehead makes an appearance on the main straight Curious as to why they have the last few starting boxes at an angle Wouldnt it be easier and more fair if these were straight Or is there a required distance between the track edge and the grid box for crews to work ad such Hold up  I work for one of these companies and havent been offered hospitality tickets Resignation incoming It seems so strange to associate AutoNation and Gainbridge with F1 and not Indycar  Aside from that Ive been curious all year to see what Michael Schumachers cruise line is like This is probably the first time since the 70s or something that a Grand Prix has these many partners on the same track at the same time We gotta bet on which barrier sponsors will Latifi hit first Space in Sector 3 for Reddit  Not too late So no zoom zoom zoom this weekend c I like this It means no part of the track looks similar so its easy to tell where the drivers are Rear will snap into Pirelli barriers If the promoters got their way it would be Lewis Hamilton is going through the Heineken 00 corner presented by GEICO Get the best insurance in the whole country Glad to see Mick sponsoring a part of the track There needs to be a Carvana sponsorship boarding That’s where Latifi will crash carrying on for Jimmie Johnson I am surprised by an extent to which this community embraces sponsors You guys are genuinely excited about them and their ads I find it surprising because personally I despise every kind of advertising that is shoved down my throat and I actively block it from my consciousness Like I do not acknowledge who the sponsor of given team or event is and you wont make me I am baffled by the fact that so many people have directly opposite point of view on this Why do you care What about the space between Gainbridge and Aramco I’m still not convinced Gainbridge is a real company Every track has a sponsor on every wall and corner but we have to complain this week because “AMERICA BAD” huh Ok Fuck Cryptocom I’d rather see a Wells Fargo ad Its like neoliberalism had a bender a threw up a F1 race track How is this shit content This is the most american thing ive ever seen in F1 These are the things that worry me about F1 in America everything is going to be sponsored Was not expecting to see my former employer here Will be a good way to see where the drivers are though Why is there a nonalcoholic Are we in Saudi Arabia or what Gainbridge eh Hmm So mow we get 17 unnecessary pop up adverts each lap 😂🤣😂 Is it me or do more indycar sponsors have placement here than cota How much more expensive is cota brand placement in comparison to miami cryptocom will drop billions on some cool shit for fun and mfs will still willingly use their service Like you are being robbed by millennials rn lmao i cant wait for this race My f1 team on f1 manager1996 after I start getting sponsors Still don’t understand why MSC cruises haven’t tied up Mick It’s a natural fit Surely this is detrimental to the sponsors themselves When theres a million different sponsors around the track they get drowned out individually Ricciardo showed up at last year’s race dressed as a cowboy and did preshow donuts in a vintage Chevrolet stock car Later in the weekend COTA hosted the world Spameating championship  How to get Americans to care aye American here for the comments 🍿 The posh stodgy European sport  When your editor tells you to add in some British sounding adjectives Just wanted to say Very well written article For those who plan to read it NASCAR once tried to get a certain fanbase interested in their sport it worked but to the cost of all the die hard fans who felt betrayed on the sport that had left them  That certain fanbase then left and NASCAR was without many of its die hard audience and without the audience it tried to get  I worry that this is the way F1 is going now and in 10 or 20 years it will have been super popular and then drop off the radar well care for a minute not longer watch Who knew all they had to do was increase ticket prices to 1200 plus dollars F1 needs to give some of us older American fans credit for having to explain what F1 was to people for so long 😩 Anxiously awaits read out of stereotypes of an otherwise diverse socially and culturallyrich OECD nonauthoritatian nation of nearly 330M people By creating fake drama I don’t understand why all these websites keep claiming that f1 ‘has cracked’ the USA There is on average 1 million viewers per race For a country with over 300 million people this isn’t that much Americans need a driver for the popularity to rise even further  I understand why but its funny  Following a driver because you share the same nationality not his skills or character God I hope America doesnt start rubbing off on F1 but I fear it already has F1 was is and likely will be European centric sport just like IndyCar NASCAR NBA and other US based series Teams have factories there karting is better there as well Despite Liberty push for the US F1 still has more fans in Europe despite gaining tracks in America 2 more in Miami and Las Vegas Neither European fans come to for example Indy and say that change to look more European I really hate articles like this because it makes me fight the urge to defend myself with Not ALL of us are like this commentary but reading those comments are often equally as exhausting   I do think there is a disassociation between the average American consumer and what is being marketed to us We are extremely aware of how on the nose the strategies are to reach us as the target audience and at least for the people I know were all typically just as embarrassed by the lack of nuance What are we to do Im not going to NOT watch a race just because its got this ridiculous pandering but at the same time F1 will look at a successful event and go See All this stuff we did is what the Americans wanted WWE style contrived title battles and results   Not worth it Thought it was a decent analysis of the American marketing machine churning right now around the Miami GP regardless of personal feelings re Americanization of the sportmedia around it Can’t wait for all races to be hosted in Middle East and America Did they put guns on the cars Just like everything else they had to dumb it down for them to understand Bless their hearts 😆 “Why do the LA Clippers trade for 2 billion The NBA is a great sport but it doesn’t have a global reach and the Clippers don’t have 20 world championships to its name So why are they worth four times McLaren”  Zak Brown  He has a very good point Benchmarking F1 teams against US sports team is just the first step they ought to compare themselves to Premier League football teams one day if not being the benchmark themselves for other global sports I mean F1 races are exclusively international in its reach read world championship F1 pride itself as elite and glamorous so why sell themselves cheap the advanced tech involved and amount of employees each team employs are mindnumbingly high and theyre highly skilled to boot The skys the limit As an east coast American the best part of F1 are the 9am Sunday morning start times Wake up get some breakfast watch the race and then it’s over by lunch and have the whole day left I actually don’t like races in America for that exact same reason That is truly an AWESOME helmet design Alonso has really nailed the use of the blue and the pink so perfectly Gorgeous Why the fuck couldnt BWT let them have this pink on their livery Looks waaaayy better than their bland shitty version of pink The car should have used this 2 tones of pink and blue  Damned corporate colors Such a cool helemt and then theres all the BWT crap all over it Im starting to hate this company I like Very cool helmet Nailed it with the palm trees and the lifeguard stations It’s Miami You gotta’ have ‘em   The most authentic touch however is that green circle on the back It’s a reference to the very rare “green flash” phenomenon that you might be able to see from the deep Keys when the sun can be seen setting into the ocean That is brilliant Brilliant Love it Some other angles Miami  pink I like 1010 but where is KIMOA best helmet of the weekend BWT is comedy The publicity must work for them However   Not that I noticed Skipped over their water filtration for the upcoming home build Probably because I’m so tired of seeing their pink everywhere I can’t honestly believe I’m saying this as I love Miami vice colors so much But damn I’m tired of seeing it already  helmets posters everything shout out alpha for their poster tho Very cool design Hot shit The blue and pink combination we wanted but didnt get on alpine So this is where Alpines v a p o r w a v e aesthetic is Holy fuck Now that is vaporwave Alpine West coast times   Practice 1 56 1130a  1230p Practice 2 56

Miami region I was expecting this American Danny Ricciardo Ricky Bubby Direct link to Video here HQ GeoBlocked so only works for people either inside the UK or outside using a VPN connected to a UK server Everyone else will get a 403  Mirror link below    Danny playfully throwing shade to Valtteri 🤣 I would support Ricky Riccardo speaking for the entire weekend with an american accent acting like its perfectly normal and nothing has changed and ignoring any questions about it What the fuck Ive never seen Geoblocked videos on Twitter before G fucking G Sky Sports lol that accent is just as foreign to Miami as his Aussie accent Years later and Danny still qualifies behind Valtteri Absolutely love it A little known fact is that every Aussie gets Honorary American status if they want it I hope we get a focused trying to beat his teammate Daniel this weekend The least funny driver on the grid Most australians dont even see him as one of us anymore anyway They can have him Honestly I dont I find it super annoying You mean the best photo of your life according to crofty Opening party What else does a race weekend consist of that I have no idea I hate that I cut off Seb in this pic he’s always been my favorite I also got some good shots of Lewis George and Charles but I don’t have an Imgur account and I don’t wanna spam the sub with posts These guys fullon looking like the hottest new boys band the New Kids on the Grid Look how happy they are Love to see it 4 wdc in one picture Get yourself a man that looks at you like Zak does at Lando Everyone on that photo looks genuinely happy to be there…good call from F1 to race in Miami Gardens… Christian still loves Seb Were cameras allowed for nonjournalists or was it phonecams only enjoy the show AND the race on sunday USA greets from an austrian F1 fan as on every race sunday my friends and i will watch from my place on sunday evening our timezone A whole episode about how Lando hates Daniel so much he wouldn’t even let him stand with the team at the opening party is coming Big dad energy from Christian and zaklook at the way zak looks at lando and Christian looks at seb   Like the proudest dads out there Poor Kev at the back lol Great pic Hope you enjoyed the party The livestreams posted on F1s official YouTube channel if anyones interested in checking it out Why did they need rush the intros was the music talent on some crazy contract to perform precisely at a certain time Kevin peeking from the BG Mick seems to gravitate towards Seb Lets be real everyone was just there to see Latifi The fact that you got a glimpse of the goat is the reason it’s a great pic If they are all there already its kinda strange not doing the official media on the thursday nice pics What’s up with Ricciardos shirt Does he wear one size bigger I was way too focused on it when watching the opening party last night Landos polo fits him just fine it looks like Carlos looks very relieved that the sand is outside the track this time Kmag Podium Confirmed  Look at him scheming plotting Dang Latifi looks like he has a huge head in this shot I watched it on YouTube and there were only a few fans relatively speaking probably less than 1k you can tell the production was trying to show as little of the crowd as possible Zhou joining mcclaren confirmed s I scrolled thru ur post history  that realistic batboy post is abnormal So what’s the over  under on the number of drivers who test positive for Covid next week I posted a few more pics here’s a link   The beaming smiles What Daniel so happy about Pursuing hobbies Original Res Photo  Well this is odd LOL Only Bloomberg would think that ridiculously expensive entry prices are something worth celebrating The article is actually a very good read BB does quality journalism How did they do it   Netflix Actually a really solid article Really great article If you dont want to read it more highlights the differences between how Bernie approached F1 vs how Liberty approaches managing the sport Netflix was a shot in the arm but if there was no F1TV or social media presence the sport really wouldnt be as popular as it is now DTS made it more approachable but Libertys management has made it consumable Love the dig on NASCAR lmao Looking like a Nintendo Power cover from the 90s Ferrari about to add caltrop compartments to their rear end That drawing doesn’t show any difference between old and new airflow It only points out where the change happened Am I missing smth SMH man i just want carlos to finish the race As someone who is a total F1 noob and new to the sport it blows my mind that that little of a change can be the deciding performance factor of who potentially wins Yes Tighter fights is all we need Hope Mercedes solve their issues faster so that there will be a three way fight I hope Mercedes upgrades work as well It would be awesome to see 3way battle between all 3 top teams Always mildly amusing to me that they are doing over 300kmh whilst seated as if theyre in a  lounge chair Original Res Photos  Photo  Photo 2  Photo 3 I know it’s been designed safely but man it looks fucking terrifying that the fuel is directly behind the driver like that This is actually a drawing of Kimi You can easily tell by the lack of drink in the cockpit One of the best follows on F1 twitter  Have learned a lot from his posts Ill be really disappointed if theres no cocks Damn that seating position gives a whole different perspective This explains the Bottass all the blood congregates in drivers’ posteriors It really shows how tightly packed they are in there with all the seating and padding around them and also see the roll over area that the halo and the rollover hoop create Whats the FIA safety camera used for Is there any footage available  I mean yeah for safety obviously but in which circumstances for example The seat is lighter than I would have expected Probably no padding either people don’t realise the amount of core strength required to be sat in this position for 2 hours with the performance of those cars go try and sit in this position yourself for a small insight No pee bags ಠಠ And a driver…no arrows point to a driver 😂 Dont some teams have their drinking system in the nose forgot the steering wheel Mercedes logging on to watch this Explained again Buchan Sport strikes again in his running series about 2022 floor concepts    I don’t get why this post is so unpopular The video tries to explain a working theory which is does rather eloquently  B Sport is still hypothesizing but as a very fresh exF1 aerodynamicist his musings are a lot more informed and interesting to watch than most youtube channels regarding the technical side of F1 this year Good theories This just looks like circuit specific upgrade  We will know if they brought any upgrades to mitigate porpoising tomorrow when they have to detail the upgrades for the show and tell At Mercedes they are convinced that they have found the keys to the lack of competitiveness of the W13 and are working hard to try to revive the fortunes of the World Constructors champion team Brackleys team was sure they had a car with extreme aerodynamics that should have given them a one second advantage per lap  The facts have shown that this was not the case and on the contrary Lewis Hamilton and George Russell found themselves as the third force with a Silver Arrow that pays a gap of six to seven tenths per lap from Red Bull and Ferrari  For the Mercedes technicians the main difficulties derive from the exaggerated frequency of porpoising that brings the nefarious hopping almost all the way into the corners while on the Ferrari it runs out much earlier as the top speeds drop  While we wait to see what Mike Elliotts engineers have prepared for the fifth seasonal event theres a weight reduction of about 3 kg we have to observe the front wing of the W13 which was designed for the Miami straights almost 2 kilometers long  The image of Giorgio Piola taken in the paddock highlights how the adjustable flap has been redesigned to reduce drag in particular the incidence in the portion that goes from the nose to the support brackets has been reduced while the trailing edge it has been reshaped with clearly visible material removals that make the profile very shaped Its around one tenth of a second if I am not mistaking right Hopium incoming I said it yesterday but I hope Mercedes can challenge at the front this season Not because I want them to win another championship but because having three teams compete at the top is better than two If Alpine and McLaren or any other team can also get to the top thatd be awesome as well but it seems like Mercedes is the closest as it stands 3kg equates to about a tenth a lap Given the margins of the midfield group thats quite helpful  For context a tenth would have seen George move up one in Bahrain Lewis into at least Q2 and George up one again in Saudi No change in Australia but Lewis would have been a fraction behind Norris Nothing would change in Imola thanks to changing conditions and noncompleted laps in red flags  Obviously this can be negated by other teams losing weight but it will make a difference in isolation Nevermind the porpoising Hopium for myself 3 kg   The whole team slaves away to shave off every last bit of weight meanwhile the guys on the front wing are like ‘our bad  we thought we needed a sack of spuds in there’ But they still have the porpoise which is gonna hurt them alot this weekend Theyve taken the sandbags off boys Its happening Mercedes 12 incoming Wings are actually the same its the adjusters on the end that are smaller Haha sandbags 3kg weight reduction is insane considering front wing only weight about 10kg I don’t quite believe this cuz some says Mercedes was just 1kg over the 798kg minimum weight Although they make this 3kg reduction they still need to adding 2kg somewhere else This may change the weight balance of whole car which may give a little bit advantage I guess Can’t wait until this somehow makes the car worse Finally can get ahead of Gasly or can he Lets hope they get knocked out in Q1 again like in Jeddah 👌 This is the same wing from AUS seems to me Thats a decent amount of weight to drop Although if the porpoising situation is not improved by this then its not really going to change much  new floor too At first I thought you meant they had unloaded aero which would actually probably help with porpoising Taking 3kg off the very front end must do a ton to help with understeer but Id be worried about even more oversteer out of the corners I was expecting to also see a very heavy zippo in this photo… Miami has so many slow bumpy corners the porpoising will cripple them this weekend What are they going to light up with a 3kg lighter A lap around this circuit seems fun I dont care what anyone says this track layout has a good mix of nearly everything you want in a track   Tricky apex turns 5816  Straights long enough to pass on  Heavy braking zones at the end of the straights  Tight technical sections that may not be good for overtakes but punishes mistakes  The only thing it lacks is elevation changes No porpoising This game is literally unplayable SMH  Also that offcenter Shell logo on the Ferrari halo looks odd I know its because they cant show alcohol advertising so they removed the logo on the other side But it would look better if they centered the Shell logo Love the turn complex under the overpass A little up a little down a little wiggle I bet we’ll see big time gaps there seems ripe for little errors I didnt buy F1 2021 because I knew it would be the exact same game as the 2019 and 2020 version I hoped the 22 game would be a brand new game with new physics graphics game engine and hopefully new netcode for multiplayer but this looks like a freaking reshade of 2021 again ffs The circuit looks awesome Seems quite long but very well done Weve heard the Mercedes and Honda engines in the game time for Ferrari Not abusing the kerbs this is not charles Is it me or does the marina have real water in the game Its like a mix of Sepang Baku and Singapore I mean it is Charles it has to be hot Right This circuit is perfect for the redbull i expect another 12 You mean DLC from F1 2017 for price of 80 Euros got it  Garbage That area under the bridge looks so clunky and ripe for a big crash Love the turn complex under the overpass A little up a little down a little wiggle I bet we’ll see big time gaps there seems ripe for little errors Probably an extremely stupid question on my part but will they actually develop different car models for the vastly differing cars on this year’s field instead of just the same generic show car with mildly incorrect liveries each time How hard is it to get new engine sounds I dont understand There are so many engine sound mods on racedepartment for other games made by people and a whole game just keeps the same engine sounds for 23 years I fucking hate codemasters Aw damn its just a repainted showcar This livery seems like it would look amazing on an AT03 While teams are scraping liveries off Alpha tauri is recycling that paint because you know environment Oh an art car that would be so cool to see them use it for the race Direct link to Video here HQ Possibly a one off livery Its gonna be another NFT by Mr Gasly Brand new factory and Windtunnel in 2024 Audi will be very happy Rather that than them taking over McLaren Aston MartinAudi Stroll admits discussions  News  ASTON MARTINAUDI STROLL ADMITS DISCUSSIONS  Lawrence Stroll has confirmed that he has spoken with Audi which is interested in taking over the F1 business and said he is very happy with the collaboration with Mercedes  Fabiano Polimeni  20 hours ago  The presentation of financial results during the first quarter of the year coincided with the announcement of Aston Martins new CEO Amedeo Felisa replaces Tobias Moers and together with another former Ferrari  Roberto Fedeli head of the technical department since June  will have to lead Lawrence Strolls brand towards the growth and development phase in the electrification era  The conference call with investors however served not only to present the Q1 results but also to comment on the rumors  very solid  of an Aston Martin approached by Audi  AUDI IN FORMULA 1 WITH ITS OWN TEAM  The scenario is that of the German brands entry into Formula 1 from 2026 They are working on several solutions where the way in the case of Porsche is better defined and looks at the collaboration with Red Bull  The track that led to the acquisition of McLaren by Audi seems to have cooled at the same time increased the odds on a possible purchase of the Aston Martin team along with rumors that also look in the direction of Williams Racing and others to Sauber Motorsport  STROLL CONFIRMS RUMORS  Lawrence Stroll confirmed the discussions he had with Audi in a brief statement in response to Bank of America explained If we have been approached by Audi yes Are we very happy with our collaboration with Mercedes yes The world of Formula 1 is full of these stories  The collaboration with MercedesAMG is very close under the industrial profile and an Audi entry in Formula 1 from the Aston Martin door would be configured with its own team to take over structures and registration  as well as benefits of the Pact of Concord  Aston Stroll has launched an important investment plan called however to produce results that so far have been absolutely disappointing in the commitment of the team in Formula 1  Strolls declarations have been understated admitting discussions with Audi and obviously supporting the technical collaboration with the power unit supplier Mercedes  Could it be the bells of an attractive offer from Audi to convince Stroll to leave the scene in Formula 1  In taking over and saving Aston Martin in 2020 Formula 1 has been identified by the Canadian businessman as a key showcase for building a recognized global brand and player in the luxury performance sector I remember a Beyond the Grid cant remember who where they made the point that establishing a truly new team is a bastard None of the good folk want to work for you  it could last three years and be a disaster Rather than facilities 90 of the value of F1 teams is the people   So I think Audi will be better off paying through the nose for something like Sauber Sounds like the best option for Audi Aston Martin is based in the UK and build a completely new facility Would be great to see a seat open up again Honestly the team was performing better under VJM Micromanagement is killing this team I rather prefer the full take over OMG Vettels 5th WDC in an Audi As long as it isn’t McLaren Please at least have it be a full on takeover then I cant stand daddy Stroll much less when he might actually win  “Have we been approached by Audi Yes Are we very happy with our collaboration with Mercedes Yes The world of Formula 1 is full of these stories”   This is what he actually said you guys want stroll gone so badly you believe Every headline Bye Bye Daddy Stroll dont forget to take Lance or let the door hit you on the way out This is great news The sooner the Strolls are out of F1 the better for all This guy is looking for someone who can solve the teams technical problems with him constantly looking over their shoulders Total micromanaging piece of shit That would be great we could see a full german team in mick seb or nico if they went full german in the marketing How does this work with the Mercedes ties Aston Martin has How does this work commercially Theres bound to be some overlap between their road car markets This would make way more sense than McLaren  For one thing McLaren has complex ownership Theyve sold off or licensed out so many parts of the business that trying to buy all of that back to absorb the brand would be a massive headache  Given the amount of money being pumped into Aston Martin both as an F1 team and car manufacturer a lot of the world Audi would need to do is already in place combined with a team thats historically pretty damn good at saving a few quid If my understanding is correct what thats doing is basically prevent car from going any lower then it should I think Ted discussed this briefly in the notebook   Its interesting because largely speaking youre better off with packages of upgrades in 2022 because its more efficient use of resourcesunless its something like this which unlocks what the car is really meant to be doing and is actually a very small upgrade  If you think of the 2005 McLaren a very small tweak unleashed the car  I think where folk are getting confused is the idea that Mercs problems are the latter If my understanding is correct what thats doing is basically prevent car from going any lower then it should Finally Merc can fix its porpoising This is why I love f1 and the precision engineering that comes with it It just looks like a few slots of carbon fiber but the change can either put you near the front or be lapped several times Driver61 video that explains this  When we first saw porpoising in preseason testing the trivial fixes people were commenting about included this one Active suspension bumpersskates etc I believe there were even specific comments from either Braun a team principal or aero SME iirc saying that those would not fix the issue  It seems like we just had a definitive article like this saying it was actually the rear suspension so it just feels like this is ongoing clickbait to further leverage this topic to drive traffic So my idea of a zero height floor actually kind of was right and could work just not the whole floor obviously Ferrari will bring this upgrade this race let’s see if this may help Last year i had a game with my family where everyone was given 2 drivers at random and points were awarded by track positions gainedlost At first it got very hectic but started getting interesting once everyone started getting engine penalties Also it was a rollercoaster of emotions wishing for your favorite driver to start low on the grid to give you lots of possible points but at the same time wanting to have your favorite driver start high up in the grid because you want to see them in the podium Would it be possible for you to share the Sheets link I’ve been maintaining a Google Sheet of my own to classify the race results and the standings just for fun And I’m pretty sure I’ve done a lot of unnecessary work to make it since I’m not too good with SheetsExcel Would love to take a look at yours That’s pretty cool makes it a lot more fun thanks for sharing  Any chance you share the templates if we wanted to replicate Fun fact more people were at the soccer stadium for Ocon’s visit and there wasn’t even a game on then at the Marlins game where Max and Checo threw out the first pitch Pink does suit him a lot so weird to see him so close to home  Higuain and Ocon swap deal here we go Poor Esteban meeting some shit soccer players while Gasly was having diner with Jordan i mean i dont think an european have to go to US to visit a football team It like econ ring his manager and said everyone is meeting some celebs hook me up with someone as well lol I assume its a safety thing to slow the cars down before entry but its a shame that it will probably increase the pitstop delta and make a two stop strategy less attractive Let me put a tenner on a Latifi or Mick DNF Original Res Photo Please not Carlos please not Carlos Imo it looks too tight for your everyday road car much less an f1 car that has the slow speed turning ability of a 200ft long cargo ship I get it could just be the angle of the photo but it looks very tight Coulthard is having flashbacks This pit entry with the possibility of a classic Florida flash flood thunderstorms mid race someone could easily end their race there and if multiple people are pitting at once it can cause proper carnage That reminds me of the Le Mans Pit Entry Chicane in a way it will test the drivers no doubt to see who can master this tricky chicane Weve seen crashes at or in pit entry before Id be intrigued to see if we get that here Since when is Latifi called “somebody” No gravel trap so Hamilton is safe Everyone staring at Latifi be like 👀 Who will cut it the most I dont like these long time loss pitlanes Since the speed limit reduction 2 stops have been so difficult so we end up with 1 stop and lots of tyre saving The drivers are lucky that it will be dry slow button on What happens if you cut the track in the pitlane Penalty Well it has tarmac when you miss the entry of the chicane so where is the problem Just because were in America doesnt mean we suddenly have to stop putting turns on our racetracks Latifi is going to make 1 fanbase extremely happy and another extremely upset then it seems cough  Latifi cough deleted China 2007 is without a doubt in my top 10 F1 moments of all time along with Senna crashing Prost out at Suzuka in 1990 and all the Bose headphones that died last year whenever Toto didnt get his way Should be long enough for people to forget about Daniel Abt yeah Noice        Back up to a full 12 team grid Aka the Peroni ad with F1 car in it This is really bad imo the car is the least obvious thing on this This is feeling more of a Peroni advert than an Aston Martin Poster to me Well it’s certainly another poster from the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Peroni F1 Team P E R O N I It lacks finesse not enough refined gradation  highlights  subtle texture Peroni bottle is too dull and looks faceted which it isnt Overly saturated magenta orb behind the car is slightly overpowering doesnt quite match her lip colour Face looks straight out of Shutterstock Its basically a bit pony I am being harsh Im tired tough titty toenails The car looks strange particularly the sidepod  BSpec leak by Peroni This sucks So who is drinking 0 alcohol beer Does this mean vettel has a name ready for the car She reminds me of Flo from Progressive Is that the same Nastro Azzurro that sponsor Valentino Rossi during his early years in Motog GTA Vice City Focus and have the girl’s face as most of the poster have the drink near her lips as if she’s drinking it and have the car in the reflection of her glasses since she’s zoomed in there’ll be more of the car and it won’t look so stupid and transparent as a slap job marketing ad This isnt a race poster this is a beer ad Ah yes the real focus of this GP This is goodas a Peroni poster  Bad F1 poster though Will it be painted to look like the ocean Ocon coming close to nando this week possibly Ocon podium incoming Allonsy A shame theres so much sponosor names flying around  The man has good taste in helmets Source   Quality of the picture is unfortunately not so good but its the only one I could find of the helmet Thats what the alpine livery should have been I thought the gp was in miami Maimi👀 I cannot believe how crowded his helmet looks Sponsors sponsors sponsors If the helmet was green Id call it Chick Hicks  I also dislike BWT demanding the drivers to pink it up I miss the distinct Fernando look weve come to love Love the helmet But are all the helmets this weekend about to look the same D Gasly Max and now Alonso all look pretty similar Going with the Miami Beach look that looks good Miami Vice colours and palm trees Muy original I see they went with the vaporwave theme How original Nothing beats Maimi If only the Alpine looked like this It seems as if everyone is bringing a new helmet design to Miami  I feel like I need to buy a Hawaiian shirt or something just to watch the race Great stuff OP  Secondly do you expect any copyright issues going forward   You should absolutely expect issues may arise especially if one of F1s broadcasters decides they want to do similar videos or features Yep good stuff ta This is awesome ill definitely check out this channel after races You should add text describing whats happening in the race   Like Max approaching backmarkers  or   Leclerc slow pitstop cool job Repost   Wait is that an American football player statue This event was so akward Ngl looks like a WWE WrestleMania entrance stage They carry on doing events like this and generating the excitement I bet they will put the crown jewel label onto Miami in no time Bottas This feels a far too dramatic headline for what Brown said in a podcast  Ricciardo has a contract through till the end of 2023 and theyre just waiting until later this year to start negotiations and talks Theyve got time and hes got time  All these rumours swirling because McLaren is testing OWard and Herta as mandated by F1 for the two rookie testing sessions seem a bit dramatic for the moment Tomorrow   Norris extends hit contract till 28  Always good to anticipate early People need to chill Results in races they both have finished this year  Lando 15553  Danny146618  He was destroyed in 2021 but is comfortably matching Norris this year  diffusor damage due to racing incident albeit his fault it was just close racing into a blind corner in the rain and not really indicative of poor performance McLaren in no hurry to sign Ricciardo Dont commit too early  Remy Ramjiawan  Thursday 5 May 2022 0757  McLaren boss Zak Brown says Daniel Ricciardo is not sure of a place with the Wokingbased team after 2023 The smiling Australian had a volatile debut season at McLaren but is also in 2022 slower than teammate Lando Norris  Ricciardo was brought in for his experience in the top of the field In his time at Red Bull Racing the Australian was still able to pick up the occasional victory When Max Verstappen joined in 2016 he was sometimes able to outpace even the 2021 world champion Nevertheless the overall trend surrounding Ricciardos arrival at McLaren is currently disappointing The Australian still has a contract until 2023 and therefore enough time to prove himself but there are also alternatives for the team from Woking  Alternatives  Brown states in conversation with Formula1com We have one more season together after this year and of course we are already thinking about the long term Whether that will be with Ricciardo or without the Australian Brown does not say He does hint however that there are plenty of alternatives ready We will test with Pato OWard and Colton Herta he says Brown wants to postpone the decision on whether or not to extend the contract with Ricciardo Its best not to commit to these things too early and were not in a hurry he explains of the eighttime race winners tenure  Ricciardo feeling better  Apart from the contract Brown sees Ricciardo doing better at McLaren this year Yes he definitely is His races are going better and he has won something in qualifying as well the 50yearold American says The man who took Carlos Sainzs spot at McLaren is also a year on Hes not quite comfortable in the car yet but his bond with Lando is more than good He has also got to know the team very well Brown explains After last seasons dip in form Brown is therefore pleased that Ricciardo has found his way up the ladder Of course we are happy that he is back on top himself he concludes Why would they hurry Theres plenty of time to negotiate indeed since hes signed until the end of the next season Can you blame them If Ricciardo continues to slump around in the lower midfield while Lando challenges for podiums I wouldnt be at all surprised if McLaren buy out his contract and go with a new driver for 2023  When its all said and done I think Ricciardo while be viewed as a capable driver that made some bad career decisions and survived off his Red Bull reputation for a bit too long ive been around here for a few years and Ive never seen such hate for Danny its like he killed everyones dogs Really not sure where its coming from tbh Daniel is only 32hes got a lot left to give in Formula One Im just amazed how far his performances have dipped I guess hes really sensitive to the car if its not working to his liking the results will be averagebelow average What he had at Red Bull and to a degree at Renault isnt translating over at McLaren I dont know what people are talking about tbh He was absolutely off the pace on Bahrain but obviously recovering from covid and lack of track action  In Saudi he qualified next to Norris and with only a tenth between them and his race pace was great before his retirement  In Australia he qualified a few places down on Lando but finished the race only half a second behind him  In Imola again only a few places down in qualifying on Lando finished directly behind Im in the sprint then his race was fucked in turn 1 Partially his fault but Bottas hit him anyway which damaged his car and ruined any fightback  but he kept going the rest of the race with a damaged car getting good data for the team   Hes a little short of Norris ATM same as Carlos is a little short of Leclerc Perez a little short of Max and Hamilton a little short of Russell But its not like last year where he clearly could not get a handle on the car Its logical for McLaren to do that Sadly Daniel since 2021 has big decline of form  losing to Lando especially in qualies adaptation problems in 21 thanks to that McLaren was P4 not P3 and only had 23 flashes For person who was in TOP 5 2020 drivers it is unacceptable I dont see Ricciardo staying after 2023 if he keeps struggling that much compared to Norris but in F1 a lot can change in that timeframe I sure hope he will improve his race pace Oh Ricciardo I really hope you can prove the doubters wrong buddy Yeah I listened to the podcast and this is clickbait  If Danny performs well this year and he has been on par with Lando every race except the shunt at Imola where he was right with Lando he will get another deal  But of course McLaren wants to see what their young drivers can do  Every team feels that way Should hold on then grab a senior Porsche seat to help them get a grip early Feels like a good fit with his late braking and all Unless something picks up with Daniel I can see them getting OWard or another one of the indy guys in Good hes too much of a wildcard atm Needs to pull off a miracle in these next few races before we can even begin thinking of a future for Ricc at McLaren Huge fan love to see him in his prime again I feel like ricciardo is absolutely no certainty to retain his seat atm His performance would need to lift substantially to justify an extension I would’ve thought I think Danny was just really suited to Red Bull cars He was known for breaking at the very last second and for his ballsy overtakes I get the feeling that the McLaren is just a different type of car and he is not suited to driving it I bet if you could put him back in a RBR car he would be placing a lot better but the fact that he has a huge salary and is getting beat by Lando are already two strikes Zak mentions looking to the future we all know that means putting an American driver in the second seat Unfortunately you don’t look to the future with a guy his age in F1 anymore It is a young man’s game now I think he would just retire He has said many times that if he can’t win a WDC then what’s the point He has more than enough money he will just land in LA and have a bunch of sex   I don’t really see him doing anything else in F1 frankly the guy is as dumb as a bag of hammers But he looks good so he will be just fine I still don’t get the Renault move he made if not for the crazy money than what else would be the reason to go to a team whose engine just ruined your last shot at a WDC He is completely lost in that McLaren for sure But who could do better  I dont think theres neither a better driver available nor an amazing rookie waiting for that seat  Maybe they could reach an agreement with Alpine and sign Piastri and maybe even use Renault motors that could be benefitial for both as the Mercedes PU is quite weak and Alpine could use the data analysis of two more cars but I dont know Smart from them Id go for someone else surely WELP  Pato O’Ward should get his seat   Two Mexicans in F1 would be so amazingly cool I love Danny Ric as much as the next one but his stay at McLaren has been underwhelming Racking up this kind of salary to perform at a mediocre level most of the time below his teammate doesnt look great Maybe McLaren value his PRpower and technical insights more than we understand but performance wise its hard to justify keeping him for the salary he has deleted He doesn’t belong in f1 anymore I would love to see him replaced by Piastri  If you win F3  F2 back to back youre good and deserve a shot RIC had his shot Now that Im used to the 18 inch rims these things look tiny lol I believe thats actually the Renault 2020 car the RS20 OT I really liked Slovenia when I went there Where did you see this As a Slovenian I feel its my duty to go see it in person where in slovenia excatly is this Holy bargeboards The nose has ALOs 14 but towards the back of the car you see Ocons 31 Hmmmmm Thats actually tadej pogacar is it just more or does that look very short That actually looks like a real car but it’s 2020 not 2021 I think based on the barge boards and the vents right behind the halo which I don’t think they had in 2021 FWIW its not last years car or any other years Its a show car  a fake car with a mix of parts in many cases they are things that were never even for another car and in some extreme cases red bull are known for this the car is a plastic shell I’m so happy we got rid of barge boards Fucking hideous They look so clunky and boxy now especially with all that greebling Saward only wrote that de Vries might be a good candidate for a Latifi swap He did not write that they were in any contact sees Latifi’s seat   “Huh I wonder who that’s for” Whether he ever gets a seat in F1 or not  I hope Sky hires the guy for more broadcasts He has the insight of a Nico in his analysis  and a somewhat similar impressive grasp of the English language  but seems to connect way better with the grid when doing interviews De Vries surprised by Williams rumours Wonder where they got that from  Kimberley Hoefnagel  Thursday 28 April 2022 1456  Last update 1505  GPFans spoke exclusively with the people involved for this article  Nyck de Vries has not yet had any contact with the Williams team about a possible switch to Formula 1 he told GPFans The driver from Sneek is not aware of the rumours and emphasises that he will continue to focus on his Formula E campaign  Earlier this week there were rumours in the British media that the Williams team would be interested in bringing Nyck de Vries in The British team would like to continue without Nicholas Latifi in 2023 and is therefore looking for his replacement According to Sky Sports the team has its sights set on Alpine reserve driver Oscar Piastri However Joe Saward a renowned Formula One journalist said that Williams doubts that this is the right move The team would rather work on its own future by putting someone in that seat who is not linked to another team De Vries was put forward as the best candidate  De Vries responds to rumours  De Vries himself however has no idea where this rumour came from These rumours are new to me the 27yearold told GPFans in an exclusive interview I have no idea where you read them the rumours ed or where you came across them But then Im very curious where they got that from the Mercedes driver stressed Because honestly I have no idea  Asked if De Vries would consider a move to Williams he replied Of course Formula 1 is a dream That is a dream for every young driver but otherwise I think it is still quite early in the season We are only at the sixth race in our championship So yes lets first make sure we get a few points here again said the Dutchman  Translated with wwwDeepLcomTranslator free version De Vries is one of those guys who went under radar because guys like Mick get F1 seat thanks to their name and guys like Mazepin got their seat by just money  Mazepin won same amount races as Mick in F2 season but he had the 5th best team Not prema Tsunoda won 3 awards in F2 that season for a reason Coming to Singapore for the first time this year Very excited   What are the major tourist attractions that would be good to do during the daylate afternoon before the F1 sessions   Is there a lot of food options that will be open late at night after the F1 sessions   What is the best transport from idk the area but from Geylang Road near ‘Eminent Frog Porridge’ to the track  Is it easiest to get from the airport to the city via rail And is google maps reliable for public transport   Sorry for all the questions haha Nice to see a fellow sinkie F1 fan here My favourite place to go in SG is Boon Tong Kee they have many locations but I cant resist their Steamed Chicken and Rice Crispy bean curd Also frog leg porridge at 4 am tastes good too Finallysingapore fans How nice of you to do this thank you   I’m a Singaporean myself haha and looking to attend this year GP after following f1 religiously since 2019 Understand that the early bird tickets were sold out so looking to get one closer to the date Having said that which areazoneticket will give me the most value and how many days would you suggest I should attend Any other tips are appreciated where can I buy one of those half cooked egg makers where you just pour boiling water it nice work fellow sg lad Is there any seb singapore merch being sold near the track I think I saw a few images of them sold in local shops as he is the lion of Singapore I have been to Singapore many many times and am looking forward to the GP this year as far as the GP goes what is the premier location to view the race from the track and what is the best post race venue Any recommendations for areas to stay at I’ll be at the Bay Grandstand and a bit lost at the moment on where to stay  lodgings wise I mean I got a ticket to the pit grandstand Taking an extended vacation from work this year as I’m working far too much and finishing it with the race Splurging on accommodations and the tickets but I love street food Fancy parties aren’t my thing Any highlights for hawker centres near the track area I love walking through cities best way to get a feel for the place so if it’s a few kilometres away that’s all good   Additionally are the concerts an all day or night thing Can’t wait to experience this Thanks so much for doing this  Do you know in general where drivers come in to the track so we have the opportunity for a picture or autograph Right now my wife and I have tickets for Turn 1 which gets us access to all four Zones I believe  We’re also staying for a week after the race Anything you recommend we go do on weekdays where there are less crowds possibly  Thanks Booked my flight just a few days ago coming from the US Houston Texas and have a few general questions    In markets and food centres are transactions mostly cashless or do you always need to carry a good amount of cash    What is the scene like around the circuit both before and after the events each evening  Packed bars and convenience shops difficult to get around etc    Does it take long to get inout of the track area like how much time should you budget for ticket scanning finding seats food and drink lines etc    Ive been told I must try Chili Crab as such any recommendations for Chili Crab locales We were hoping to go to the GP as we are vacationing in Bali at that time but a 3 hour flight is just a bit too far for a one day trip We will be sure to plan it better next year have fun you all I depart in the morning to go to Miami for my first Grand Prix Have tickets in the turn 1 grandstands Does anyone have any advice Really excited for the GP most of the track looks like it should be fun from a racing standpoint and from a viewers standpoint   I still hate the overly tacky couple of bits but depending on how the race is directed I hope I wont have to see the stupid marina and beach more than once I dont understand the rampant hate for this GP before its even happened once So many F1 fans are just obnoxiously stuck in the past All this hype around Miami feels like F1 is trying to replace Monaco Does anyone know if RedBull brought further upgrades to Miami Or are they running their Imola update package This feels like the ultimate apples to oranges comparison where there is no correct answer but here goes  What is the best part of any track to be a viewer at  In other words if you could have a front row seat to any place on the F1 calendar where are you sitting  Is it where the track is  Is it how good the racing is at that specific part  Is it how good a look you get at the action US people going to Montreal  what is your strategy for getting tested before returning to the US  Our hotel is kind of boutiqueey so its not offering inhotel testing  They sent me to this service  Biron  that is expensive but does testing  Im wondering if there is anything else Im missing  Thanks I’m watching the Classic USA 1982 F1 race in Las Vegas on Sky F1 what a terrible looking track I didn’t realise it genuinely was in the car park of Caesar’s Palace looks like it was throw together in a few days I’m genuinely beyond excited for the Miami GP This is hyped up a lot by the videos and F1’s investment Looks very exciting Has any Grand Prix been hyped as much as Miami this year   Singapore 2008 might be that one as it was the first ever night race in F1 but I dont think any other race matched the hype Does anyone know of any F1 related things to see outside of the circuit itself I know that there’s a Red Bull show car in front of one of the hotels and there’s a Williams pop up somewhere but other than that I’m not sure of anything happening around the city Austin was great for a few years when it came to F1 stuff to see around town Im in the UK where the F1 TV app doesnt work for live streaming without a vpn but does anyone know if you can watch recent races the day after or week after  I know it offers historic races but I just want to know how recent of a race you can watch What happened to that Show and tell thing they were introducing this year I assume I have just completely missed it but I thought it would be a bigger deal when I first heard about it Iv only just got back into F1 but I feel SkyF1 are very pushy in terms of getting in the drivers faces etc and they had an interview with Christian on the pit wall mid race How do you add the F1teams to your reddit name How are race distances determined As far as I know they have to be at least 300km  Ive come to learn that the upcoming Miami GP will be around 308km So why is it this and why not one lap less or one lap more  Thanks Question for some of you Grand Prix veterans the Miami Grand Prix will be the first for my friend and I We have seats at turn 18 and I couldnt be more excited to actually watch in person Just wondering whats the best way to watch Have the F1TV international broadcast playing in headphones for commentary Is there much of a delay Or will the screensproduction there be good enough to follow whats happening Any other tips and tricks are super appreciated Are ticket prices normally this high for an F1 race I was so excited when they announced the GP in Miami and was planning on going It would be my first GP but prices are soo high Im discouraged to purchase a ticket at the current prices Im looking every 30 min for ticket price changes Does anyone know a good place to purchase tickets Or even have an extra one Honestly any advice is appreciated thanks OverUnder on how many times we see Brady and Jordan on race day I am genuinely excited not just because it is in the states but I like seeing new tracks   With that said was there ever any talk about holding it at night I mean I understand the issue with timing and having a race at 010300 in Europe but racing under the lights at this track would be amazing Anyone know of watch parties in NYC Not usually my thing but Miami seems like a good one to watch with a crew I want to learn more about the science behind the cars Does anyone have good resources I am very knowledgeable about physics so I will take any references Idc if its meant for a child or a PhD I have an extra room at the Eden Roc for Miami The hotels are now going for 1200 USD a night I paid 300 and would be willing to transfer to someone for the 300 a night rate… best place to offer this up I am currently awaiting my requests to join some Facebook groups for Miami How was ferrari allowed to test a new floor during the pirelli tyre tests  40 of rain on Sunday in Miami 👀 Why Are you guys so hard to please Anyone else surprised that nascar is having their Darlington race at the same time as the Miami GP I dont personally like nascar myself but Im wondering which series decided on that timeslot first and if the other decided to compete directly by design or if its just an unfortunate coincidence  Wondering what the fans of both series think of this I do love F1 for making one of the few races on the calendar that I could have a drink during since its not on at 8am happen on mothers day so I get to miss it on the road I don’t watch much Sports Center and I’m not in Florida but disappointed in the lack of hype for this race in the general media Seems like there was a lot of talk after Texas last year Not sure what I’m expecting but it seems to be very quiet Does anyone know anything about the relationship in the garage at Alfa I feel like I’ve heard relatively little about the team despite decent performances from Bottas and Zhou just saw they are 4th in Constructors I’ve heard rumours about a RicciardoGasly swap does this rumour have any merit Or is it just something to gain attention It is so annoying how hard they’re pushing the GP Sending George to a heat game LeClerc checo and max to a marlins game Pierre meeting Jordan and Lewis with Tom Brady No Fernando at the Miami opening Not sure why F1 is going with the So Bad Its Good approach for this race any idea Has there ever been an F race where they just threw up a race track and no one really knew what was gonna happen on it like this From my understanding Miami has a lot of long straights and Red Bull has been the fastest on the straights Therefore Max is the favorite this weekend Is this thinking correct Anyone order Miami merch from Mclaren Just curious if anyone has had their order ship yet I ordered on launch day and only got an order email nothing about shipping yet Was hoping to get it before the race Sunday Whats the best site for buying GP tickets second hand Ill be in Houston during the USGP on Oct 23 I found some tickets on seatgeek is that any good Is miami open to general trackrace activities beyond f1 like Cota Or is this strictly an f1 venue When do you think the seasons first race without a safety car will be I feel like the DRS will be overpowered here the one in the finish straigh line looks fine but the other 2 seems to long Can someone explain the water meme that’s been going around before the Miami gp Anyone going to Baku Recommendation on hotels hey guys i see you pop up on my frontpage from tiem to time so i think of you guys once in awhile   well today a live streamer his name is Jake was invited by the mclaren racing team so hes in the cars and in the pits  Any Charlotte NC fans in here so what will be the fast lap time in practice  will there be any safety cars in the race i say yes I need to get this off my chest Other than COTA the f1 season should not recur in the USA Not Las Vegas or Miami It feels like an money making machine now why would they give the USA out of all countries three races It’s beginning to feel like a joke at this point I’m actually looking forward to hearing some peoples opinion But this is driving me crazy the tracks they create now seem so familiar it’s so annoying at least take DRS out now if the cars can race closer And for the love of god design a track that isn’t walled off Make it safer and more accessible to other sports Adopt new tracks just don’t create these long straights where that’s the only way to overtake It’s getting annoying at this point 22 races is too much Drivers know they can afford to DNF out of 12 races and still win the championship Make it less make every rave worth more Okay I’m done Hes a shit person a bad driver and his countrys government is fucking up but Nikitas 2022 helmet was nice as hell Is there any elevation change around the Miami track or is it all flat Im not super privy on how the point system has worked over the years but has a championship or maybe even a position in the standings been decided by a fastest lap If not is it possible with current system Ok so we know that track time is limited in f1 cars The only times they can practice is during fp1 etc   But whats dripping them from getting in an f2 car and taking it out to get a feel for the track Does anyone know anything about the relationship in the garage at Alfa I feel like I’ve heard relatively little about the team despite decent performances from Bottas and Zhou just saw they are 4th in Constructors English version   For the first time a Formula 1 race weekend will take place in Miami The route in the Sunshine State is therefore completely unknown  the drivers could only test it using the simulator The fans are all the more excited about the performance of the individual camps and which updates can be expected After the debacle in Imola special focus is on Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton for whom the new terrain in Florida could also be an opportunity Opponent Red Bull on the other hand is on top after the double victory in the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari World champion Max Verstappen won ahead of teammate Sergio Perez and at the same time caused disillusionment at the Scuderia which could not live up to its expectations at the Ferrari home game World championship leader Charles Leclerc finished sixth Carlos Sainz retired Nevertheless the outcome of the coming race weekend  not least because of the unfamiliar track  is completely open Said street circuit the Miami International Autodrome which runs around the Hard Rock Stadium of the Miami Dolphins has many challenging corners and a 128 km long straight ready in which top speeds of up to 320 kmh can be reached Three DRS zones also provide a spectacle The pay TV station broadcasts the race Im just glad Mazepin is not racing this track  Feel bad for Latifi already tho'"

       "'Translated by DeepL The FIA is going to enforce more strictly the rule that drivers are not allowed to wear jewelry and wear their own nonfireproof clothing Indeed it will become part of the technical inspection of the car It was before the Australian Grand Prix that the driver notes prepared by the race director highlighted some already existing rules Drivers were not allowed to wear jewelry nor were they allowed to wear their own clothing that was not homologated by the FIA Lewis Hamilton among others took umbrage and indicated that he would in fact be wearing more while Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff was surprised by the new race directors focus points Is this the battle they want to take on Hamilton now Well if this is the worst were not complaining Teams now actually risk a penalty That mention of rules that have been in place for a long time had to be read as a warning at the time as it now appears Now in fact the FIA is going a step further Before the start of each weekend the teams have to sign a document declaring that the car complies with the technical regulations Now however two additional passages have been included on that form The teams have to declare that the drivers do not wear any jewelry and therefore do not wear their own clothing RacingNews365 has seen the document with these new passages These two aspects are now part of the technical inspection of the cars which means that if they are not met the teams registration must be considered illegal Normally this will result in an exclusion from the race but in practice it is possible that a fine or a grid penalty will be imposed Toto Wolff already reacted to the shifting of the rules in the presence of RacingNews365 and has now expressed a more nuanced opinion We have to remember why the FIA is doing this namely to prevent injuries caused by jewelry Nobody is waiting for a freak accident in which that plays a part so the FIA has to draw a line somewhere Is this a key issue I do not think so but I understand where its coming from “So What is the dress code” “Business Racing” Inspired by the colour of flag that he will see more of this season The checkered sleeves are a homage to the type of flag he used to see ahead of others in the past seasons Aaaaaaaaaaand as always he looks like a pretentious knob This is half the reason I do not like the guy hes always got to try and make a statement The sleeve reminded me of HP sponsored Williams Is “his blue outfit” a thing… Bruh how is this man not sweating buckets Hamilton switching to Corvette Racing in IMSA confirmed Zhous shorts are stylish Instagram story of both of them I think Max is wearing his GF’s glasses 6 drivers 3 cars the Red Bull academy has too many drivers not enough seats Jesus look at the Williams’ top speed If only they could figure the rest out Williams The best or nothing Do Not forget to peg Bottas as your Monaco winner in fantasy Note These are broad categories thus not every corner type is accounted for McLaren for example excel in MediumHigh speed corners and mediumLow however this is not included to make it more simple Very surprising that Mercedes showed up so well in medium and high speed corners as well as on the straights It would seem that porpoising would prove the most disruptive there These look correct Haas does its best on Medium speed corner what track is best for that Direct link to Video here HQ That T1 camera crane must be higher than any of the guests in Miami this weekend Volume up The only thing I Am not looking forward to this weekend is baking in the sun Wonder what the track surface will be like Original Resolution Images from tweet Image 1 Image 2 Image 3 Is that a Miamispecific livery Eh that livery is way too busy for me So much going on its almost like camouflage Slightly unrelated but the BH Jordan had a pretty good color scheme did not it That paint looks heavy lol That paint looks heavy lol I love the air intake It is perfect Looks a battery Maybe a bit out of place but it is great I love the Duracell design Until the brakes explode Hope they fixed that issue Original Res Photo I suspect they need to reduce drag as the car is designed to gain most of its downforce trough the floor Less drag could also result in less porpoising as we see DRS also results in less porpoising The downside is that they lose downforce in general So if they cannot fully utilize their floor they car is just flawed beyond repair The best or nothing Are all of the Merc changes marginal incremental this far in 2022 Yup that is it that is the key Let us fucking go I guess this is a good time for Ben to see how things are being run over in America First meeting Roger Penske to discuss Indycar and now meeting Jim for NASCAR Saturday Race 1 230p ET ESPNEWSESPN3 Sunday Race 2 1035a ET ESPN2 More info about all this here Nice This is big news for them How long till we get a female F1 driver MotoGP satellite teams do not buy chassis Moto2Moto3 teams do howevever they buy entire bikes with motors gearbox and all from factories It is close enough to a spec series to call it one And being a spec series is not negative the actual racing in Indy is fantastic As a massive Indycar fan it is essentially a spec series IndyCar is a spec series though K sir this is a wendys Much like FE it is a mostly spec series I suppose this post was meant to be posted in rIndyCar IndyCar is between being a ‘spec series’ and an ‘open development’ series Being in the middle bewteen both approaches allows them to attract new teams as there is development on the table while keeping the costs reasonable Its a similar approach to what Formula E has been chasing lately The ‘spec series’ part of the equation allows IndyCar to have close racing Despite being in a Meyer Shank car or in a Dayle Coyne car you still have the chance to fighg for pole positions and race wins That is something which does not happen on series with ‘open development’ Having free development on shocks and dampers does not make IndyCar a series focused on ‘open development’ It is a very important part of the car but it is not the whole car Letting IndyCar teams fully develop the chassis and have special partnerships with engine manufacturers would only skyrocket the operational costs of IndyCar For all intents and purposes IndyCar is still considered as a ‘spec series’ because of the same chassis gearbox body which is ultimately what the spectator and average fan will look for The racing is still pretty much what you would find on a ‘spec series’ like Formula E or Formula 2 IndyCar is in the middle of the road and that way of operating has been beneficial to them I Have been getting into the ferrari challenge series It is a super spec series The cars are 100 identical and yet there are still like 10 static adjustments you can make and 6 realtime adjustments Spec means that the cars are mostly identical as opposed to open or box designs Indy falls closest to the Spec category Cannot imagine that being too comfortable in the Miami heat When you have to meet with the Queen at 2 but going skiing at 3 straight outta mortal kombat Mans never hot Is not it like blistering hot in Miami right now This is one of the first Lewis fits that I am genuinely confused by Blueis Hamilton I love this one Usually cannot stand them Awesome Fact he is

breaker under dress cloths Looks like a Jester Drowning in drip Get that guy an oxygen tank runexpectedsimontemplar Looks like he would fight Jackie Chans or Donnie Yens character halfway through

king at it again Man could not go to the Met Gala so he makes his own show I love Lewis style but this really seems like it should have been a one or the other type deal The blue suit is sick The jacket is sick They look bizarre layered That Is Sir Lewis to you Tracksuit is LV Sunglasses are offwhite Someone please id the vest and pants I wish I had as much confidence and money I mean no hate or disrespect but can people explain to me why this is considered to be fashionable Or is it just a you get it or do not kind of thing predicting his race being blue flagged High fashion is dumb change my mind My man’s got swag Prince is turning over in his grave This one is a miss Too bad the last few ones were drip Too cocky for a second driver of a midfield team These guys in general must be pretty acclimated to higher heat humidity I Am sweating just looking at him Does anyone know if hes still featuring black designers Met Gala was earlier this week Lewis… Lol omg The weekend has begun do you think he has another layer on under the jacket to really seal in his drip A lot of people fail to realize hot hot the drivers get in the cars wearing this is nothing I swear hes intentially taking the piss now That is some actual king shit Alright this ones actually pretty sick That Is gifting him about 20lbs That is the same cloth as blue flags My boy like to train Agility I usually am amused at his outfits but this one is just really bad ahahahah Mans won the fit battle this week this shits just goofy do we have a sub just for Lewis drips i am all in for it Hahaha Not climatefriendly manufacturing new clothes every day The man should focus on his car as much as he does his clothes… perhaps then he could match Russell Looks like a dork The court Jester has arrived Is it a minute behind the frontrunners Really dig it bar the strap how much is it a million Wonder if it bounces up and down on your wrist if you move your arm I love the colors but watch prices are a bit too much for me If they did the watch face in the Petronas blue it would have been like the Tiffany Nautilus Quality of the images are pretty poor but I Am very glad to see the introduction of the Duracell colours Blue and copper is a hot combo How long until the Williams mechanics strip that paint off to save weight Nice idea Original Res Photos Photo Photo 2 That Is a very cool paint job it immediately invokes batteries Well done to the designer Man the picture in the replies is great Looks fantastic Those cheap bastards using a combination of left AND right corners to design their track… Glad they did not replicate the tyreshredder roundabout Where is the top view Hanoi was an absolutely brutal track in F1 2020 Could Not stand it Miami thankfully looks to have better flow Wait so Hanoi is not real I Have been hating a fake track for years So Nice catch When I watched the Miami F1 2022 gameplay I was genuinely confused for a moment thinking it was was Vietnam lol Valtteri’s social media shenanigans do not get enough appreciation but dudes more active than almost any other driver on the grid when it comes to random wittyenjoyable content It is incredible You can see the Instagram video of this here Valtteri is clearly having fun xD He really is living his best life these days is not he Good for him In all fairness to the pose he is about the size of one of their cheerleaders So is there a sports team in and around the Miami area that an F1 driver has not been to see in the past 4 days VB always looks like one of the biggest drivers but those dudes make him look tiny No Tua in sight ESPN later today F1 driver also hates Tua Brazzers Bottas a fin with the fins Laces out This has way too much NSFW meme potential And you know exactly what i am talking about Man being on Mercedes REALLY suppressed Valterri’s public character Alfa seems fun Leaving that porpoising tractor has been the best decision ever for Bottas He looks joyful Laces out LACES OUT need a picture of Valtteri with Christian Wilkins Leaving that porpoising tractor has been the best decision ever for Bottas He looks joyful he really loves that alpha shirt lol These F1 guys are so gosh darn cuddly looks like the intro of a porn movie XD Just some guys being dudes Lol F1 drivers are tiny Well at least its not weird No no no I love how it is about racing fun so tired of people on social media pushing their personal agendas HAMBURG May 5 Reuters An agreement for Volkswagens VOWGpDE premium brand Audi to join Formula One by investing in British luxury sports carmaker McLaren is becoming increasingly unlikely a person familiar with the project told Reuters on Thursday The price expectations are too far apart the person said adding that while the project had not yet failed its prospects are now close to zero Meanwhile talks with Swissbased Sauber which runs the Ferraripowered Alfa Romeo team and Williams are continuing the person said Both Audi and Volkswagen declined to comment A tale as old as time Always has been I see that McLaren is doing everything to be customer and have almost 0 chance for title fight Is this a sabotage or something I really hope they buy Williams they could use a helping hand More detail on new wing changes from Scarbs More analysis on new FW by Scarbs These just some regular downforce adaptations to a track rather then a true differentiator of airflow or something radical Are these the radical changes Mercedes is going to bring to become P1 again They cannot change the nose without a new crash test right So the 3 kg is all in the wingswingtips I honestly do not see 3 kg there but whatev Is this the only update they brought You can polish a turd but at the end of the day it is still a piece of shit Old looks better FUTURRRRREEE Face Lift Mario Party Mini Game Its Florida there is always a chance for rain its what happens when you build your state on a swamp That pretty normal for this time of year This is actually good bit hot weather for Miami This is just showing there is the chance for a quick 30min1hr pop us shower Very heavy rain chance but it is usually quick Its a peninsula It rains frequently I lived there for a few years and its super common for a single cloud to roll through and drop an inch or two of rain in the span of 30 minutes then go back to sunny Weather apps does not tell us a lot they are all based of a computer model with no human input Just watch the TV meteorologist or check NWS Miami on the morning of race Source I Am a meteorologist When I lived in God’s Waiting Room it seemed to rain everyday in the morning and afternoon for a 20 minute shower 39 chance of getting 7 one hundredths of an inch rain in the forecast We might get some real water in the marina Surprised nobody has made a joke about the fake marina yet Yes…maybe…meh 40 chance of rain with a high of 90F lmao Event goers are about to know what it feels like to lose 10lb in an afternoon Florida weather It could rain real hard for a couple of minutes or it could do that nearby and completely miss you It is pretty random The lights make it look cool I like this one It is different than the traditional blue and pink theme It is clean Big weekend for you Yuki and need to lift Rooting for another great race As a general rule see full rules a standalone Discussion post should be of interest to the sub

They do have some very outlandish opinions sometimes but they have a good crew of former F1 race car designers and people that were involved with F1 for years I enjoy it Missed Apex is the way Matt Trumpets NYC guy in particular is a knowledgeable yet very understandable F1 pundit I Do Not Know if its the best but ShiftF1 have a primer episode to get you informed Its episode 178 Missed Apex gets my vote Also i would just skip to season 4 of D2S and watch it Its interesting to see where the teams finished and where they are at currently F1 nation official F1 race preview and reviews especially the race reviews got a lot better this year with direct interviews from the paddock with drivers and other team personnel Missed Apex and F1 Beyond the Grid Any time Joe Saward is on Missed Apex is what you should listen to I like Scuderia F1 podcast Missed Apex is my favorite The panel is great and occasionally hilarious ShiftF1 podcast It is a longterm US podcast but very accessible They have a preseason primer episode to get you up to speed I quite enjoy Missed Apex They can be biased towards Lewis especially end of 2021 at times but I enjoy the structure of their podcast and they are usually the first to get a show out after the race I also like the Ringer F1 Show WTF1 just watch donut medias video on youtube on f1 Its really good and WTF1 has good information for beginners too Glad to have you in this community and i hope you start loving the sport we all fell in love with here 3 You definitely need to binge watch DTS S4 from last season beforeas you fly down there Also like other have said episode 178 from ShiftF1 is all you will need to listen to Id recommend back of the grid if you are a brit Not a podcast but Chain Bear on YouTube and B Sport also on YouTube have some great explanation vids on aerodynamics track regulations tyres porpoising that type of stuff Ask in daily thread Contrast and compair Zak to some of the other CEOs and damn is he an amazing personality in the sport God I wish that were me Also did not F1 ban plane flybys this season I was super bummed when they announced it There are pilots and then there are the Blue Angels who are absolutely insane Wonder if Daniel or Lando would have wanted to go but Zak was like “Drivers cannot go Too risky Oh by the way I am available” Thhe Blue Angels is the only thing I have seen in person that rivals F1INDYCAR at speed Truly deathdefying Amazingly Blue Angels shows and Top Gun movies are net positives for the US Department of Defense That is actually your tax dollars working for you The recruitment benefit outweighs the expense Also the Blue Angels are the most bad ass flying formation in the world but there is a reason the Navy will not allow the Airforces F22 to fly at naval Airshows it is the most stunning and maneuverable airplane that will ever be built by humankind Zak definitely seems to be living his best life these days Also seems like hes been dropping weight lately no I feel the need… Man is living life Would be really cool to be a multi millionaire deleted Original Res Photo There are many posts showing this particular car its the Renault Rs20 from the 2020 season not the a521 Its got both drivers numbers on too No comment after 2 hours How are you planning on organising this gathering lol Flea market display with Gucci prices 450 for a tshirt 💀 Haas offering their caps for 30 is the only reasonable thing I remember at the Hungary GP when I was 10 I begged my parents to get me a Lewis Hamilton McLaren cap They told me its too expensive but they got me one it was 20€ Buying the haas cap cannot afford to be a better fan than that Is that 130 for the purple mercedes hat or is there something below it That cannot be right TIL my budget is “Haas” Even if I had it I would not spend that kind of money on a that McLaren Racing F1 New Era 940 2022 Special Edition Fade Miami Hat Is 42 on Amazon fyi Lol slap that tiny F1 logo 110 Gtfo I Am good lol Haas first year cap for 40 of new big Team caps Yes please That Is a big premium on the merch Gene gaining some fans 🇺🇲🇺🇸🇩🇪🇩🇰🏁🙏 Statistically speaking how often is a sucker born Wow really judging my past self for scoffing at 20 cocktail drinks at COTA in 20162019 range that even included the nice glass it came in This weekend is going to be all sorts of level of stupid and throwing huge amounts of money away it will drive people crazy There is always someone stupid enough to buy those prices make me think this is a tent outside of the track somewhere trying to scalp people i do not think these are actual f1 shop prices There is a sucker born every minute 30 bucks Haas cap let us gooooo F1flation 80 for a year old cap Seems about right Eff that 450 for a 6 button tshirt Hell no I Have dropped some serious coin at Texas GP before but I went home with a lot of stuff This is BS Looks like the same prices as Austin last year I got my cheapass 40 Austin Grand Prix hat and loved ituntil my dog ate it If I had spent 130 I might have wished the hat ate the dog since he would be cheaper to replace There is a huge markup on this stuff You can buy the same shit on their websites for much less Probably the venue taking their cut here Is this possibly a stand that is outside the track Or is this an official stand Pretty similar to COTA last year Looking like I would be rooting for Haas HAAS for the people This is USD Jesus that is ridiculous prices are probably going to be outrageous at the Montreal grand prix You should look into Americas Cup merchandise This garbage in Miami is targeted at millionaires Pfft I pity Americas Cup merch is targeted at megamillionaires For a half a second I almost considered getting a 230 Prada Americas Cup tshirt after a friendgirl said yeah but I Am pretty sure that is the least expensive Prada product ever offered for sale You might want to buy a few Edit I Am broker than shit I Am just really into sailing Everyone that reads this post should look into the AC If you did not know 95 of AC fans are F1 fans but only like 1 of F1 fans are AC fans AC and F1 are very similar they are all about rules design engineering and fluid dynamics But the AC has both aerodynamics and hydrodynamics If you like F1 you will like the Americas Cup Its priced similarly to other prestige events like The Masters Americas cup etc Peter Millar is just a scam though Nothing could make me buy their sportswear All of this shit is way cheaper online 80 for a hat 110 for a shirt 🤣🤣🤣 ok I scared to even convert dollars to my currency It is all Putin’s fault First time at a GP They are always insanely expensive Went to Austin in 2018 and 2019 and the hats were 60 shirts and jackets were 80120 That was 34 years ago add inflation and popularity and you have todays prices Peter Millar is not cheap but a 14 zip pullover is not 450 It is 150 tops Are these prices standard for buying at the event location I was planning to buy merch at the Canadian GP but it looks like I can only afford Haas 🥴 Polo better come with a hooker F1 is for the rich Those prices are a joke lol This is what happens when Americans buy the sport SMH Fans are counted as revenue streams only F1 and Miami two things that are not cheap honestly these prices are pretty close to normal nfl Merch in Miami at a game If you worry about prices Miami is not for you I just do not understand the appeal It all looks like tat to me My wallet is pleased What the actual fuck And prices will only go up through the weekend Bro ☠️ Heading down there now Clearly will not be buying any merch and am going to eat a large breakfast and lunch just buy them on aliexpress few bucks Ridiculous basic shirts with a logo on it not even cool designs or whatever WTF That cannot be real Bwoah merc white cap is free right right Yet another reason to support Haas and Gunthers Go Fund Me for a new boat Teams overcoming budget cap with overpriced merch prices s That Is just sad driving people away from representing their brand When I was in Imola this year the Ferrari baseball caps were 60€ and Mercedes 40€ and I thought that was outrageous lol Does anyone buy these at these prices Beer goggle pricing Surely they would make more money in the long run by lowering the price This is nonsense Modern day pricing is usually based on demandsupply rather than a fixed margin over cost That Is why so many mega companies grow in value so much because they keep reducing their costs keep increasing their margins and keep increasing their prices While a cap might be 30 on the website they know they if you do not have it and you want to flaunt your support for a team you are going to get it even at a premium Hence the inflated costs for things that are relatively less expensive online That is insane I know merch prices do not reflect all prices but man I feel at this rate I will never be able to afford to go a f1 race in the US Between travel and price of tickets for more than 1 person it just is not possible unless I am looking in the wrong place I remeber going to us GP COTA and hats being like 45 dollars and that was 2016 inflation has not gone up that much 110 dollars for a tshirt kind of pricey f1 how much is the program like 90 dollars Not abnormal for races in North America I went to Montreal in 2010 and prices were insane even then 70 for a hat 110 for a shirt and 200 for a jacket Lmao what Fanatics has this all Where Is that famous budget cap That white polo is legitimately more than a third of my monthly rent Definitely would cop that Haas hat I am so embarrassed for this whole event so far I see supply and demand is in full effect regarding the Haas hat Always knew supporting haas would pay me back somehow haha Wait until this guy finds out how much pimento cheese sandwiches are at the masters lol Miami GP is F1 attempting a total cash grab from the American elite And I get it F1 cars are expensive Bummer middleclass fans are getting gouged for souvenirs Cheaper than in Brazil GP at least Well that is gross I love F1 but I feel like attending a race in person or buying the Merch is targeted for the Uber wealthy Damn Ill take that HAAS hat for 30 Are those online anywhere I remember Liberty Media saying they wanted to treat each race like the way the NFL does with the super bowl These prices would back that claim Christ they cannot be serious250 for a polo i know inflation is bad but dam not that bad Why did they do my haas like that The Crack mentality continues right down the food chain Haas being real ones I would take a HAAS hat What The Fuck I would buy the Haas hat Do they not sell Pirelli caps at the race what does the 450 shirt do I mean I have two kidneys so I Am kind of glad everything is expensive Now i do not have to worry about spending any money while at the event I guess if you can afford 2k ticket you can spend 450 on a fking polo… god damn The team hats seem to be about the same prices they were at COTA in October I have never seen generic F1 merch so overpriced though Everyday Indycar becomes more and more appealing to me I mean apart from the polos… have you been to a concert recently Inflation I own zero merch because of their BS prices BRO THOSE HAAS PRICES BE BANGIN Haas with the closest to a reasonable hat price Sorry but 450 for THAT Whoa I remember going to Silverstone 2019 and it costing £80 for any teams tshirt Absolute joke I ended up getting a senna hoodie for £30 instead because if it Do Not let them rip you off Jesus christ Meanwhile it looks like a flea market in a third world country I always found it interesting that the Seminole Indian tribe now completely owns Hard Rock International this makes miami RB’s fifth home race on the calendar Looks like the hump at the chicane took max off guard That long straight is just a showcase of the cars straightline speed considering there is no way to set yourself coming out of that chicane Professor Max His ease at the wheel almost makes you think he does this kind of thing for a living I enjoyed the commentary on it as well Hope those two kerbs are not so big in real life or his underbody might be in for a world of pain Looks cool Very long straight I assume he is in Assetto Corsa running laps I cannot really tell what sim he is in but I know AC has a mod with the track Interesting In the other Sim laps videos that RB posts I mentioned how he has a little twerk of his leg whenever he goes full throttle I actually found a video from a Mexican pr thing with Albon where you could see both drivers legs Max did it as well Alex did not But in this video no twerk Or maybe its the camera angle right between his legs Is that the actual Red Bull sim That chicane is like a cannon Comparison between the new rear wing and the old one via Duchessa Dear lord even more colors popping on that Merc car I think it is the same front wing but with a different adjustment They should replace the Petronas accent colors with these new color patterns Weird livery Seeing magnussen do well is such a great story So incredibly happy for him Hopefully Mick can bring his performance

Schumacher wants a future in Formula 1 he must not look old against Kevin Magnussen The Dane is a surprise for David Coulthard Author Norman Fischer CoAuthor Erwin Jaeggi 05052022 1725 David Coulthard Mick Schumachers future depends on Magnussen duel Mick Schumachers future in Formula One depends heavily on how he fares against his Haas teammate Kevin Magnussen says former driver David Coulthard Schumacher was seen as a rising star after his convincing performances against Nikita Masepin in his first year but has stagnated somewhat this season For so far Schumacher has been pretty much disenchanted by Magnussen The Dane made his Formula 1 comeback at short notice after a year out and has scored points in three out of four races so far Magnussen has already scored 15 points while Schumacher along with Nicholas Latifi is one of only two regular drivers without points Micks future depends in many ways on the comparison with Kevin Coulthard told the Dutch edition of Motorsportcom at an IWC Schaffhausen charity event at Miami Beach Golf Club When you get into Formula One you are given a rookie year but then you have to deliver the Scot said People do not wait for you to be quick You have to be Mick beats Magnussen only with hard work So far the Germans career has actually gone to plan Schumacher was champion in Formula 3 and Formula 2 and according to Coulthard also had a very good first season in which he established himself The unknown however was the comparison with teammate Nikita Masepin Schumacher was clearly in control of the latter though the Haas was too slow to compete with other cars But with the arrival of Magnussen and the better performance of Haas there is now a comparison and in that Schumacher is currently still inferior In Kevin he now has someone he can only beat with hard work says Coulthard preferring to highlight the Danes performance rather than belittle that of his predecessor Masepin The fact that hes consistently getting the Haas into the points shows that it was the right decision to bring him back Coulthard Magnussen drives liberated But the fact that he currently has such a grip on Schumacher also surprises the former vice world champion He explains it in such a way that Magnussen had actually already finished with Formula 1 and is now getting another unexpected second chance in which he has nothing to lose It seems he is driving liberated he says In his first career with McLaren and Haas there was always some anger in his style Now however Magnussen is simply driving consistently well and is 31 up against Schumacher in both qualifying and race duels go to overview Mick has had it quite easy against Masepin so far but now he has realised that he has a fast teammate in Kevin And that has pushed Mick He has to step up now said Coulthard I think its a fascinating battle It will be interesting to see how Haas will develop No Very cool thanks How do you find out about the pop ups The Race Is Lewis Outmatched by Guanyu A sith drip lord Boy got drip Cannot deny What lot is that sneakerheads Yes mate My fashion 🐐 Finally lewis has real competition this year 🔥 Looks pretty normal other than the

ruins the look He looks like the doctor from Idiocracy Getting his win this weekend fellas Cannot wait until McLaren cuts this guy Get my guy some AC Did bro dirty lmao That Mercedes has sidepods XD Are those the old tyres Why do they look so weird That thing is in the background I know what it is I also know that no one was asking my hand shot up faster than a fat kid asking for seconds Its called Flys Eye Dome and it was designed by Buckminster Fuller This is a recreation in the courtyard of the Art Museum I first saw it at Art Basel Miami Side pod Merc Side pod Merc Side pod Merc Damn there is no way its that hot there where at in miami What´ s with the W13 The floor is different the previous Side Pods but on the other hand a new and much thinner rear wing Here Is hoping they dial back the sensationalism somewhat Seems like some drivers and teams are pretty upset about last season and less footage is not going to help them They definitely could have made a more compelling ie true story out of last season I think One episode will be about the rivalry between Latifi and walls I feel like best case scenario is they mend some bridges with a less sensationalised season 5 and season 6 goes back to what it once was Otherwise it will just be Red Bull Steiner Christian Horner Zak Brown Geri Horner Danny Ric and Christian Horner by the end Guaranteed that Miami gets its own episode Hopefully the series reinvents itself because it desperatly needs to The quality has been on a decline since S1 Steady at first with S2 then sharper with S3 and off a cliff with S4 Season 4 was for sure the weakest but hopefully they F1 Liberty FOM take any criticism from fans and the teams to refine the format I just need Toto to say Pumpernickel once an episode I do not think its an unreasonable request I am pretty sure by the end of those 2 seasons no drivers will be willing to participate They have not been happy with their portrayal on the large This last season was so bad I hope they rethink how they are doing things I hope the attrocious reception of the latest season prompts them to dial down the fake drama and focus on the real stuff a bit more I cannot fathom how they managed to fuck up the last season the perfect material for a banger of a season was right there and instead they focused on Mazepins early pitstop They also manged to anger some drivers which could have been easily avoided Hell ask some of them about their best moments and tough battles and you might even start endearing yourself to them Will Buxton on Twitter 😂 2 more years of having to hear about people who hate the series so much that they will not watch They should expand the number of races episodes Hope 5 6 are better than 4 That last one was a snorefest I Am here for more Haas episodes Season V Guenther strikes back Hopefully they will take some of the criticisms on board and focus on storylines that are actually happening instead of just manipulating the footage and the interviews to tell whatever narrative they want to tell And while were wishing for far fetched things I want a date with Gahyeon from Dreamcatcher Cannot wait to watch about heroic Prince Charles slaying the Satan Max next season Here Is to 2 more seasons that releases during the season opener rather than the season break where it would be more sensible to watch Formula 1 gatekeepers in shambles 😐😐😐 It is pretty early to confirm and for the first time it comes with 2 seasons Do we know what happened in the meeting between drivers and Netflix I enjoyed the series but I Am really really hoping that Geri Horner is boycotting S5 S6 I had to FF through so much Country Life footage last season No surprises but christ they need to step up the content quality Oh no Its getting worse each season I think that they should do a second Netflix show that is more serious DTS is a great hook but there is room for more content It would be really cool if they could do a deep dive and follow one time for a whole year By the 6th season all the drivers will not want to be featured so it is going to be all actors pretending to be the drivers with 100 made up storyline’s And another 2 seasons of manipulative pictures of F1 Cannot wait to not watch Here is to hoping they stop with the fabricated bullshit when they have enough content to produce a good series with the drama they already have And less Susie Wolff please it is Drive to Survive not Manage to Survive Still do not understand why we need more fake drama in newer seasons if its mainly to attract new fans Are they going to start the show from Season 5 As someone who does not give a fuck about this show let me just do my old man moaning Why the fuck am I getting a BREAKING NEWS push notification on my Formula One racing app to tell me some Netflix show is coming back for another two seasons Ugh Another thread of copy and pasted comments in every Netflix thread Like an actual game of Reddit bingo I have liked every season enough they do not owe me anything The show is what it is if you do not like the format then stop watching Just realised if they continue down the route of overdramatisation they are probably going to use Landos sarcastic comments in some stupid convoluted way Should set the record straight on how the powers that be feel about the series Lot of people were using vague reports to insinuate that the series was unpopular and done for DTS has been an overwhelmingly positive thing for the sport and for the smaller teams and lesser known drivers in particular If you watch the episodes of a single topic from all seasons back to back the ones with Gasly Gunther Haas Cyril and Ricciardo really stand out as amazing pieces of work I Am really looking forward to the future seasons Hope they make more time for Williams Alfa and the shenanigans at Aston Martin Hope it documents the races a bit more and the way it sways from race to race rather than make up rivalries and force things on us Do not mind the BTS stuff if it actually includes more stuff about the car and ermmm the racing aspect Season 4 was average given the season was crazy Original Res Photo Needs a box for cutting away from the on track action to look at some clueless celebrities in a teams garage I like these but sad no rain related space I do not like how many squares are based on final race results All the pre and midrace squares more interesting If someone has too many squares based on final results there is no point playing Here is the link to the prediction competition Sad no Latifi crash at turn 16 My prediction From all the preweekend talk you could have “Fake Water” as the free space them showing the yacht party with the fake water on tv miami puns Column 3 is looking good The pitlane chicane looks like its asking for trouble mediums are pretty decent most races VSCs have been pretty common and I favour Vettel as a driver over Stroll Also poor Latifi and Sainz they just cannot catch a break All the Best Welsh Dragon That was informative Huh I did not realize the adjustment guns were designed to only rotate a predetermined amount but it makes sense I wonder if they have a setting on them where they can add more if the gun jumps out of the head or if the guns are smart enough to not turn when there is not a load This is super interesting Are there any other teams or maybe drivers on tiktok Would love this kind of content on my feed Aston has a very good social media presence for their behind the scenes stuff Not a fan of the team but I am subscribed to their YouTube channel for all of the videos they put out Great share rspecializedtools I really do love the behind the scenes looks that TikTok has brought us It is stuff that even 5 years ago would have been invisible to the average viewer just because nobody thought to cover it I need a lot more content like this The irony of tiktok a platform filled with teenagers and kids being where F1 teams showcase this kind of technical stuff is really funny I always wonder what they meant by 1 and 2 etc for wings Like is it cm Mm Or just whatever unit they use And can they go 05 maybe The changes do not look too drastic I am curious as to how that small angle affects the aero load on the FW Gif will not open Commenting to find it later I have never wanted Tiktok before and now suddenly I discover I need it damn you Aston martin and your super cool informative clip That was cool as fook But I Am pretty sure during race pit stops andor Indycar they use something akin to an allen wrench Great video except that tic tok thing at the end Cannot they just get Max there to bend it a bit The first and last step are missing First ask permission from Lawrence Stroll and at the end have the correction approved by Lawrence Stroll This special tool A Bit driver F1 you are cool but you are not building the iron man suit or performing magic lol We know what a bit driver is Most of us even have one in the garage showing a 403 error to me anyone got a mirror link Its crazy how much more hype he gets over someone like Palou who won Indy last year and is leading this year Lot of work to do if he wants to reach F1 Is he quick No doubt but hes also erratic and prone to unforced errors Nashville 2021 Long Beach 2022 Barber 2022 etc If he can consistently unlock his speed without mistakes hes got a chance but not many drivers can Colton is great but hes got some real early 2018 Verstappen vibes about him Id say Pato OWard is a better candidate for a potential seat at McLaren but then again if its an American they are specifically looking for Original Res Photo Wonder why he is not in the car for a practice session this weekend O’ward is a better driver I AM GOING TO So much hype for someone who is still learning to keep his shit together when racing for big points Herta is an awesome driver and talent do not get me wrong but hes still a bit far from being a nice suit for McLaren in the near future Id love to see him in F1 but Id also love for him to first get more consistent in Indycar hes such a 2019 Charles Leclerc right now mega fast but error prone and hotheaded This mans rapid and needs to replace Ricciardo once his contract runs down McLaren are disappointed with how Ricciardo performed last season citing they do not pay him a large contract to be underperforming The team is firmly centred around Lando Norris a delighted Zak Brown exclaims He should get SL first to think about F1 Plus without at least one season in F2 I do not see his potential F1 time as a success story Stop trying to make Colton Herta happen it is not going to happen The grid is really young I do not think it will be anything easy to get anyone much less him a seat If his somehow turns out to be 45 I can think of 2 major companies that would throw money at his team Move over Heinekenthe Las Vegas F1 title sponsor is Let us not rush a US driver into a seat due to the growth in the US Flat Brim helmet How to spot a Dutch person 101 Not wearing a helmet when cycling Original Res Photo Going out for a rip to scout the track Better slam the stem Do we really need to post every single tweet on the subreddit Why is this something worthy of posting by bike This puzzles confuses and enrages the American Yes and Lewis has just woken up and took shit deleted Not worth posting to be honest What does BAME stand for This is always controversial on one hand yes there absolutely should be more of an emphasis inclusion of nonwhite youth but it never goes well when there is mandatory spots for someone who has something that is basically just cosmetic different about themself People will just say “oh he is only here because he is ” Is he sponsored by Winchester Edit NM his son is No it should not we should live in a socialist meritocratic society where the background of some people are not tied to its past and were black people and some other minorities are not always in the backfoot compared to white people in the west though Asians do not count since they are on the same wealthy and educational level or higher than white people removed meanwhile the williams are trying to get rid of it lol Engineers working day and night to reduce weight of that merc Design team its free real estate Because of the new NFT thingy car going to be 0001 sec slower because that paint People do realise this is vinyl and not paint right Original Res Photo Funky I am loving the Miami color schemes I hope the Mclaren “leaked” special livery will be used A special livery Oh god we are going to beef for p19 and p20 then That will look good in victory lane Sunday For a team in as much strife as Mercedes it does seem a bit of a meme they are adding paintstickers while others are removing it Are the really that important for a works team I was hoping for neon wheel covers but all right For those not wanting to open up Twitter Norris posted a couple of pictures of his helmet for Miami his helmet is a basketball Mercedes has photoshopped his helmet to replace the basketball in an imagine of Jordan dunking One of the replies was really good Original Res Photo Slam dunk Do what you want with those words Merc admin do be killing it lately Its an upside down Alligator I am just saying That 3rd DRS zone looks really short It will be interesting to see if it is long enough to give some good overtakes So is there any team that favors this circuit Long straight looks like redbull power train Are the minisector lengths determined by the amount of time it takes to complete them Honestly looks like it could be a cool layout Via Adam Cooper Some small tweaks from the FIA to the Miami DRS zones even before the cars have run Detection 1 is 7m later D2 is 3m earlier and D3 is 4m earlier Meanwhile Activation 1 is 37m earlier Feels a bit weird having the first two DRS detection and activation points on the same straight given the corners preceding them are the very sort where the trailing car will lose time Just before T78 and just after T13 feels like it would work better from a racing perspective I swear the track is rotated differently on every map I see Why is the corner in MS04 not a corner but the straight on MS09 have a corner 9 I always wondered how circuit length is determined exactly My guesses were centerline length or average of inner and outer white line length Guess they use the centerline I will save this pic handy to know for when I am following the mini sectors on the timing app This circuit actually looks really cool Id love to see elevation changes but some of the curves are a real classic design DRS 12 could be huge for someone Turn 10 is going to be flat out and I cannot understand why you would even call that a turn Why does not the map have the pitlane You Would think that an FIA map would have something that important lol New Circuit Map Link to official FIA Document Edit For reference here is the old circuit map Its nice that the DRS detection points are all after a corner rather than before so you cannot play DRS games on the brakes in the same way they did in Jeddah for example as you will lose out on the longer flat out sections after the detection points So they are longer why now I Am scared of too easy overtakes even more Will be changed again if it does not help Toto enough Why is F1 making DRS zones in to gimmicks Two zones is fine but for some reason they are adding more and more to make artificial overtakes and drama Speaks to the failure of these new regs Rulemakers were saying DRS could well be eliminated with the new ruleset no DRS on the showcars for a reason right Instead DRS is more than ever before do not fall for the nonsense folks All for the spectacle I guess Miami needs to be an overtake fest These DRS zones especially between 911 and 1617 seem way too powerful I do feel the corner being so much more open visually on the inside with the wall moved back will encourage some to send it Its a lot less intimidating The last 5 cars are quite musical E A A E Doubt they lift still kind of like it Honestly if I had not been reading about the renovations I doubt I would have even noticed anything was different aside from the bigass grandstands of course Friendly reminders from 2021 of why changes are necessary I am drooling I doubt they will lift in a Formula 1 car but still the new look to the Radillion corner is very good its got the same fearsome character as it was before but with a Stand looking down onto the corner Those got to be the best grandstand seats ever right I suppose it is a little bit different Lol 😂 it is the same kind of Even the GT3s look fast af F1 needs some more static camera angles like this Not those 400 too far zoomed in tracking shots I could watch that shit all day I remember the good old days Find somoene that looks at you like Toto looks at ChristianMax Make sure Guenther and Kevin do not drink too much or stuff might get fook smashed everywhere Are opening parties something that is done for every tracks first race weekend or is this just cuz its Miami Never knew this was a thing before a race weekend What you doing step Fred Seb looks slouchy lol I Am actually surprised so many poster designs went with vaporwavesynthwave I was hoping more of the posters took an interest in art deco architecture Cuban influences or even pastel beach scenes Hell nobody even did a proper Miami Vice throwback lol The clichés just keep on coming Was hoping for checo firing off an m16 and max doing a line off the front wing runixporn has better vaporwave art than this I definitely like the way they have gone with the poster synthwave I believe but still its really nice This one is nice Haas still wins no questions asked everyone complaining about the same theme from all the teams but I Am loving it Keep them coming I wish teams did more oneoffs throughout the season than they already do Especially with helmets some of them seem so bland for the season and only get creative in the oneoffs Love the synthwave vibe Does anyone know if you can buy these somewhere I Am excited for the inevitable comparison video that shows how inaccurate the Codies version is They have managed to create a track before it was built yet they still have not managed to completely rebuilt Spa Going To look so realistic with porposing keep landos head away from zhou This is kind of hilarious I like the basic design and lack of sponsors Love the touch of his signature as the commissioner It must be weird going to hold this helmet expecting to feel the grippy leathery texture of a basketball and instead feeling the cold slick texture of bare carbon fibre Love that he did something other than the neon pink and palm trees that everyone else is doing Goofiest helmet design yet I love it This is so cool it is almost stupid Props to Mclaren as well for giving that much artistic freedom This is a really cool concept and design Is there a reason for this though Is Lando a huge basketball fan Or cross promotion with nba Finally an original design If lando gets another podium and all the mechanics congratulate him by tapping on his helmet during parc ferme its essential a basketball game Man is going to look like a GTA character They should paint the T cam into MJ’s palm so it will look like he is bouncing a basketball down the main straight Its genuinely so awesome I hope he raffles it away like he did his Monaco helmet Wow that is good nice to see a big difference in helmet designs from normal Like it used to be That is slightly insane Damn it looks like real ball That is hideous I love it so much Went from 🥎 to 🏀 It looks so real The Halloween pumpkin helmet is totally happening irl soon right Right Edit Missing word helmet Love Lando for this I can smell this helmet through the internet WINNER Really that is awesome and will look great in the orange McLaren Also many drivers got the pinkblue on their helmets so this one really standsout A Lando Superb design and a brilliant idea Really cool This is sick I love when drivers do full concept special helmets like Dany Riccs football helmet design for Austin a couple years back instead of just adjusting the color scheme with a few design tweaks This fits so well with the McLaren color scheme as well wow well done I am overwhelmed with different emotions I do not know if this is my favourite this weekend but it is the most memorable This is perfect Especially with the Heat up 20 in the series Okay I am impressed with Lando for going for that helmet design that is so awesome This is so smart I love it Cooooool would definitely grab a miniature of this if one is ever made can i ask a silly question does this come out of the teams annual budget I think is the most creative helmet design that I Have ever seen Looks great best helmet this year Aiyooo that is fucking awesome This is cool AF Love it That Is one of the coolest helmets I Have ever seen Love it This is the best and funniest helmet design I think I have ever seen I Am not normally one to comment on another mans helmet but that my friends is stellar I fuck with this It was a tad jarring at first but the more I looked at it the more I liked it Really different and really cool Baller Insanity Wow that is amazing really perfect Pretty cool how the lines are reminiscent of his usual design one of the best helmet design right now for me i could not believe it at first it looked like they actually attached the leather of a basketball to the helmet WOW This is legitimately one of the best helmet designs I Have ever seen This makes me very uncomfortable I mean…this is sick I love his helmets This one is great Just like the pizza helmet Nailed it Such a simple idea rATBGE Go Heat Might be my all time Favorite design McLaren is lucky there is porpoising otherwise they would be penalized for traveling Is Not someone at McLaren a part owner of the Phx Suns or something like that There in the playoffs right now so maybe that is y he has a basketball helmet Lmfao just wait til we see hes got a custom race suit too I hate this with ball my heart Not sure if intentional but a cool touch I noticed is how the seams of the basketball design is similar to the blue lines of his regular helmet The rnba rformula1 crossover we all need Hahahawtf What a bizarre idea — and its freakishly well executed Me”Lando Norris will never be ballin’” Lando Norris Brooooooooooooooooo this is absolutely caked in cool OK that is legitimately the best racing helmet I Have ever seen I kneel Sick Nah this is goated My God it is… it is… beautiful 😢 That could have very easily looked like shit but its so painstakingly accurate and detailed that I think it works I like it a lot Much better than the boring 80s neon miami vice GTA style ones This would not have made sense if the race is in Seattle rTIHI Haha this is so much rATBGE rATBGE I Do Not Know this is like rATBGE material to me it just seems wrong 🤣you need a better picture for the first one I literally thought it was a basketball with visors tape to it I like it It is not like basketball is something exclusive from Miami but at least is not another vaporwave design and it is not crowded with Spam like the one from my man Alonso Good old OurLando Florida Would make a lot more sense for a race in Indy but pretty cool Wearing a basketball helmet outside of a Football stadium is certainly a choice how many guys going to hit landos head like it was a ball That Is a nice football Ironically being held around the football stadium nowhere near the Miami Heat or basketballs of any kind kind of cool but kind of ugly lol Does the world think of Miami as a basketball town Genuine question and kind of hilarious if so Why though rATBGE And he answered super bowl instead of NBA finals clincher court side It disturbs me how realistic this is Id hate going to touch it and it feeling smooth and hard not bumpy with some give We got to see Danny Ric’s but I think it is safe to say Lando wins the helmet race It is so cool… but it bothers me sooooooo much that the panels are wrong Ball is life Cannot say I Am a fan of this one Landos Helmet Max does not need one He just shaves his head bald and paints it to look like a football helmet Checo one the other hand will put a helmet around his helmet because hes scared But Max is not He does not fear anyone or anything for that matter Helmut Marko probably I like the idea but I do not like how it looks Hes gone from tennis ball to basket ball This is unbelievably cool though goddamn This has to be the sickest helmet design I have seen in a long time Ok this is actually one of my favourite helmet designs from him ever This is spot on This is so cool lmaoo I do not really like it but it is definitely very well done rATBGE Aweful taste but great execution I hope everyone on the grid calls him “Basketball Head” all weekend a la Hey Arnold Hot damn that is a good lookin lid Its revolting Well done Did Not he answer Superbowl over NBA finals in the would you rather video That Is originaland pure Good thing we can still have this kind of design for once without 5000 sponsors desecrating the design philosophy or someone complaining about his trypophobia or something The ugliest helmet I Have ever seen kind of hilarious though as an American i love that F1 drivers come to America just to fucking let loose and do all the goofy things Wow Very nice Amazing Basketball sucks 57 Perfect score my god it is hideous Ew lmao Everything about this GP is cringeworthy Ready to score a three pointer race It triggers my trypophobia I hate it I like it ratbge Possibly the coolest and most original design I have seen Will definitely stand out Great job to the artistdesigner The least aerodynamic helmet on the grid Should Have saved the design for one of the mercedes or ferrari drivers Can just imagine them bouncing up and down the straight lol I want to dribble it this looks amazing rATBGE EDIT Subbed in the wrong direction Coming from the guy who does not know what city the Lakers play for lmaoo FUGLY I hate it Lando Magic ummm no horrible Epic And yet Gasly met MJ Lame Why is the lamest sport in America invading F1 This is stupid…I said it ducks Least fav of the weekend But concept is admittedly a little cool My eyes Its at a football stadium WHAT Does it actually have the raised bumps It looks like it with the way the light is reflecting on some of those pics It looks like when you mess up the air bladder in the ball lol I am not sure if I absolute hate or absolutely love this It is definitely one or the other Whole grid is going to have a special helmet at this point lol 🏀 Bro no fucking way lmao I can feel it with my eyes I doubt this is why Lando went for this particular design but the NBA playoffs are happening now and ESPNABC has a big chunk of the broadcast rights and they will be airing the race so it works as a crosspromotion for Disney as well which I am sure they will mention and appreciate Damn that is astrometric that texturing though… That is fucking awesome The detail is incredible Blursed That looks really cool I think Looks like a real ball Amazing Someone needs to put this on tradingpaints immediately Do you think he likes basketball This is truly awful and I love it Le Mau this is actually disgusting but its done so well lmao Lewis and Charles should be wearing it boing boing boing I had no clue they got helmets for specific grand prix I just thought they used the same one New meaning for bouncing on the track Bruh Noooo way Should have put the Miami Heat logo on it LET US GO HEAT Pretty sweet helmet but let the porpoising begin 😂 I read the first two words quickly as Nandos The colour of the helmet does not help nor the texture I think maybe I should lay off the chicken for a while I love Lando this helmet is awesome but the child in me is hoping Danny Ric takes a marker writes ‘END’ next to the giant bell logo on the back kind of cool but kind of ugly lol Whoever painted it did a phenomenal job the texture looks so realistic All that work and money for him to DNF Interesting to not show the front lol My helmet has a sticker on it saying that I cannot paint it or add any stickers to it or it will no longer be effective How TF did they do this was it tested at all Bruh All fun and games until instincts take over and Ricciardo tries to Dunk Landos head He wins the Best Helmet Ever award That Is one of the coolest helmet design I Have ever seen Suns in 4 Straight 🔥 This is awesome MOVE IT BASKETBALL HEAD This is my favourite helmet ever I like how they made it look bumby without it actually being bumby I wish it was bumpy though lerbonjanes you like what you see Some people in the comments who do not think this is cool What is cool to you I do not understand how this relates to Miami It is not really a basketball city The Miami Heat have had empty seats all throughout the playoffs… that is fuckin rad That as the kids say is dope Friking awesome Move it football head No Miami Heat logo Is there any backstory of why its a basketball themed Head like a fuckin orange That Is beautiful My favorite helmet I have seen so far What Is that plastic thing on the back of the helmet for Best helmet so far I love it so cool Now this is next level Cannot believe it is right in my backyard and cannot go Drivers will do anything to get a signature from MJ to be honest I would do the same Heat culture baby I mean that is incredible This is just good moneysaving by McLaren Recycle and reuse Outfuckingstanding This is one of the most completely random helmet designs of all time and I Am here for it It was designed by a guy called MDM Designs you should check out their Facebook he does quite a few drivers designs Baller If it was a videogame helmet paintjob you could change this would be the annoying one developers give everyone for free as an incentive to buy better ones for money NBA JAAAAAAAM Lando confirmed for the remakeif it ever happens Lmao “genuine leather” Let Us go Heat rtrypophobia WILSOOOONNN Basketball helmet at a football stadium 🤣 cannot blame him though the heat actually win Albon trying to explain Bear Grylls I want a whole video of people explaining shit to Charles after seeing people explain smoothchunky peanut butter and Bear Gryllis to him 😂 i can almost guarantee it was lando with the boom mic Crofty in the background blagging a free Williams shirt😂😂 This is one of the best videos I have seen F1 put out recently Really enjoyed it 19 Drivers Miami is great I Am enjoying the golfbasketballbaseballfootball Max its all about the race yeah Absolutely love this format It is informal but it does not feel forced to me The drivers seem chill spontaneous… not easy with a camera in their face and knowing it will be shown to the world lol Sidenote Change my view or not Based on looks Charles is the most beautiful driver in the history of F1 My fav bits are drivers greeting their exbosses i know its such a small thing but still love to see it nonetheless SebFranz GeorgeJost CarlosZak Of course Yuki talks about the food The man lives for it My pride hearing Charles say in America you feel like anything is possible ‘MURICA One of the funniest Videos F1 has done for a while Max really is all about the racing Russell looks like the most generic dude on the planet Look up man in the dictionary and see the picture If you look closely Lewis is actually trying to push against it and drown the W13 in the sea The cars fucked perspective makes it difficult for me to appreciate the rest of the poster I really like the paintbrush strokes in the sky though lewis with the initial d pose Crockett and Tubs Just putting this out there Mercedes produced shit posters in the past 4 races and their results were equally poor Now there are news about car upgrades in miami and this poster actually looks decent Mercedes 1 2 God Souria really knocks it out of the park with these I Am so glad to see she is getting recognition and work in the industry If anyone wants to see more of her work you can find her soudraws on twitter Russell looks like the safety instructions card guy onboard much about any airline has Some Miami Vice vibes Nicely drawn poster the water looks exactly as it does in the marina Looks like the car is up on an invisible front jack in no other team posters 2022 budget restrictions scream so loud To Be Honest it looks stuffy and kind of lame compared to the others HAMs face in this poster has that Ah shit here we go again vibe I wonder who the artist is because that is really good This poster is brilliant Just absoloutely amazing Hopefully their car is as good as their poster Ah a poster to match the car they produced So bad My brain hurts when I look at the rear right and front right And there is a palm tree on the sea oh wait it was not a sea right still Nice looking poster Feel like this is what Alpha Tauri wanted theirs to be lol I like the art style of it Love the pre race posters the teams do They are trying Everything is so bad with Merc this year Haas did it first and better Could someone better in Photoshop than me please add some dolphins jumping in the water Edit maybe also take out that monster palm tree out in the ocean You can literally see how excited they are to drive the W13 from their faces Russell has Frank Grimes energy The car actually looks like its bouncing I Am impressed Wow they totally got Bottas looking wrong Again George Russell as the front figure of the poster What Is going on here Its definitely the right move to make from the FIA to show that it is in support of the

Bottas and Zhou are wearing the same suits as James Crockett and Riccardo Tubbs on the poster of the original Miami Vice TV show A refreshing design after seeing all the vaporwave bluepink posters and

motherfuckers do not miss Biiiig Tintin vibes in this one Zhou and Bottas look so good in this art style miamindia Alfa Romeo always set a high bar for a poster and this is just amazing definitely got a tintin vibe about it with the art direction of the drivers This is a wholesome poster It makes me think that Bottas Zhou have bought a house and are about to settle down together Alfa Romeo posters one of the greatest really wish I could buy them It looks like we might have gotten a sneak peak at Bottas helmet for the weekend too Why does VB look like an adult Caillou 🤣 Random indian flag is random edit I lived in south florida for nearly 2 decades and had no idea that miami had a flag or what it looked like Fun fact Miami’s flag is older than India’s flag 1933 and 1947 respectively Alfa nailing the poster game again Is the Indian gp coming back Looks like a tintin special closest well ever get to an Indian Grand Prix now I guess Damn this one is really great The better poster for Miami GP I was wondering why there is an Indian flag🇮🇳 there then I saw the palm tree Never knew that Miami has its own flag Bottas looks like Tintin Tintin I scrolled past thinking that is the Indian flag That Is a beautiful poster they win this round Love the references to Miami Vice Don Bottas D At first I was thinking what the fuck does the Indian flag have to do with Miami Alfa aesthetic is just always on point I do not understand the Indian Flag s What is the other flag Looking almost like the Indian National Flag This just has a lovely vibe to it They put a drop shadow on GRAND PRIX but forgot it on MIAMI Tintin Goes to Miami Really thought that was the Indian flag for a second until I payed closer attention and looked up Miami flag All I can see with Bottas outfit is Robin Williams in The Birdcage Am I the only one who sees a TinTin style going on With how much they want the track to be Monaco its pretty ironic that their flag is basically just Indias There you go The real Kings of poster design shows the way once again Enough of the Miami Vice inspired posters Ugh The roaring 2020’s That is raw What Is up with all the custom designed stuff for this race Its it because the track is new outer is this going to happen every year Thought this was Last Shadow Puppets fan art for a moment TinTin It looks like Dale Gribble as Bottas Got Confused for a second thinking that was an incorrect representation of the Indian Flag Google told me that is Miami city Flag Reminds me of the movie the birdcage lol Is that the couple from the birdcage Is that Bobby Hill This reminds me of the poster with the weird butt Why does not this sub put as much effort into art with all the other tracks lol Lovin it though Classiest of them all What have they done to Bottas nice to see a poster styled from before the cocaine days People were hating on the alfa livery but it looks really good even when its not lined up My favorite for shure Thought it was the Indian flag for a quick second Work by Jalcalara They Have done several Alfa posters previously in this gorgeous ligne claire style Wtf indian fags whata f Love this style Very Tintinesque Buddh international autodrome Alfa Romeo designers do not miss do they At least someone is graphic designer is sticking to the non crypto design scheme Okay it is a comic in a country with a rich comic book history Not an I the only one who thinks that the style is more FrancoBelgian comic than American I get strong Tintin vibes here But looks really nice Such a beautiful poster I wish Manor had managed to hold on they always did good work Man those clothes…I am in Florida and this morning humidity at my house hit 90 and it is 95 degrees outside right now This is giving me some real Tintin vibes I love it

performed automatically Please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorformula1 if you have any questions or concerns I do not think people really appreciate how difficult producing a live event for television is when the “most important thing right now” is constantly unclear in contrast to football or baseball or basketball where the ball is always the top priority No offense but this post kind of screams of “I do not really know what I am talking about but I am going to tell people how to do it anyway” I do not think “F1 producer” is a real job overarching job that involves the same people inrace and in this preevent and creating the graphics And for the intro event I am sure there were some time constraints in place that they had to adhere to Obviously you are still free to have your opinion and some of your points are valid but I think there is a lot of confusion on what some of these people do and do not do The intro party was just that an introduction I Am not sure why you expected teams to be interviewed or anything like that To be honest they really should have just put the teams out without having them make a statement which would have made the whole thing cleaner The only real issue I had with it was a clear lack of direction Seemed like Crofty had to steer the ship like an MC which was pretty weird for this kind of event Race broadcast complaints are just silly honestly The races are live and the people broadcasting can only see so much from their angles They do not always know when there is an ontrack battle going on When a decision is made to cut to replay or change angles its generally too late to cut to something else I could not enjoy it because they kept rushing everyone in and out making it VERY obvious that they were under very strict time restraints My guess is the time restraints had to do with wanting a nighttime vibe without having a latenight noise permit like Zak Brown which was the only American on the stage Sad Otmar noises I think the replays of the start have become such a thing because recent history has shown the race is won or lost on the start Hopefully as the racing on track gets better and cars can now follow more closely and even pass the broadcast will adapt to that and show less start replays You can also replace F1 producers with Fans Fans sometimes do not understand what the fans actually want and would benefit from the most Not saying you are wrong but fans make the stupidest requests most of the time Quite odd how you portray your own personal opinion as what the fans want You Are not speaking for everyone else with these arguments so do not act like you are I am a fan too and i prefer the broadcast to stay like it is F1 should just let fans run everything I Am sure it would be great What You did not enjoy looking at Sainz blank stare instead of watching Leclerc rejoining the track after Norris last race Not just the start replays what drives me through the wall is the need to show the crowds reacting to a drivers battle over the actual action on track I do not want to watch the crowds and miss the action I Am not asking for much An opening ceremony or launch party for a race event is ridiculously over the top and why a lot of people were cringing when Vegas was announced That is going to be so much worse a level of cheese on a grand scale I cannot wait for Liberty to sell up when they have milked the sport for all it is worth Completely agree about ridiculous start replays when there are still opening lap battles going on I can understand that midrace sometimes the most interesting moment is missed but it should still be done better as well I think that live timing with laps and sectors should be either free or very inexpensive Data access is big for f1 fans who stick around Finally more wide shots rather than tracking cars from very close which removes the sensation of speed Its not a good look when amateur videos from smartphones provide better viewing than professional broadcast Oh and same goes for filtered flybuzzing car engine sound Understanding a fans perspective and adhering to it is one area the sport really needs to learn in order to grow The media that covers F1 is very entrenched in the sport they have been around for decades Because of this often without realizing I think they carry the exclusivity and elitism the sports history is entrenched with F1 under its previous management viewed themselves as an elite rich prosperous group and marketed themselves to that select few As the world has become more digital there is a switch in where people go to get there sports coverage Think barstool vs espn I think part of F1s hesitancy in embracing this change is they very much like to control the narrative I do not know the solution because for them as an entity there are extreme benefits to being able to control the narrative or the story You better get ready for 60 of the race to be fan crowd shots this weekend Tv director has been shocking for a while i am going to Most over in rindycar suggest Penske has been eyeing up an endurance race since he bought IMS Could also just be a courtesy visit I would love it if F1 came back to Indy I attended a few races back in the early 2000’s when they were there and would love to go back with my wife for a race she is only interested in F1 no other racing unfortunately Is he Penske material The scenes if the US gets a fourth race at Indy The AntiAmerican squad going to have to be on suicide watch Before the comments flood in F1 is not and has no reason to go to Indy In 2020 penske said he was interested in f1 but that no serious talks were happening this was back when a fia official went to see the indianapolis motor speedway facilities I Am going to assume the same situation remains neither penske nor f1 is interested i guess penske is bussy with Indycar and there is not that much money for f1 in indiana I Do Not Know i for one would hope indy comes back eventually Why would not the head of the FIA go see the head of IndyCar and the most famous circuit in the US Original Res Photos Photo Photo 2 Photo 3 COTA indy and long beach would be the ideal 3 USA race calendar F1 Indy 500 just for the Lols Penske has little to no interest in hosting F1 He could literally be talking about anything 4th US race in 2023 confirmed “You like money” “Fuck yeah” So he only sometimes wears a thawb I went to the miami eprix years ago formula e and got grandstand seats Between the track and my grandstand were a line of trees so i could briefly see the cars zip down the straight between the trees for maybe a quarter second I wound up leaving my more expensive seat and watching the race from the general admission area Karun Chandhock spun right in front of me and maybe 15 feet apart we shared awkward eye contact Its the ability to Instagram it is what you are paying for Honestly 1000 is pretty cheap by Miami GP standards considering cheapest grandstands were 800 so I am not surprised You are basically paying for the experience of being somewhere near an F1 car while getting a tan and drinking beer Brazil living the dream 150 for 3 days 25 beer 2 beverages Ya but when are you ever going to feel the sand between your toes at an F1 race 😂 You think they care Hint miami was not chosen because of its die hard fans You are paying for social media clout not to see the race Uh you would probably stand up for the actual race Is Not it hard to judge without a view that is actually from the seats Like they care They are there for the sand booze and because they heard that is the place to be in Miami this wknd lol If you tell them the race is between the safety and medical car they will believe it lol Just like the thousands of people who travel to Coachella just for vibes you bet your ass that the people who forked out 1000 for these beach chairs are not going to care much about the racing Who cares Most people there do not even know how F1 works Its all about famous and rich people getting that instagram post with some champagne and networking From what I remember there is not a tv in this area The opposite side is surrounded by stands I think they will have to watch it on a tv in the HardRock club Its not about seeing the cars Its about being there and taking Instagram stories If you sit at Rascas or on your yacht in Monaco you cannot see the cars very well either Its about showing off Hear the race live but watch it on TV from your beach chair still seems not bad These people probably are not there to see the cars anyway Most of the people probably are not going there for the race anyway The most surprising part of this post to me is that those seats are only 1000 F1 could have had this race at the Daytona or HomesteadMiami road course God forbid people pay to actually watch a race and not just flex on the poors Wait there is a race Everything about consuming this race in person is a total shit show It leaves me concerned for the Vegas GP Am I the only one thinking there is not an actual safety Barrier for the beach side Did they not think of elevating it This is making the mistake of assuming the people who paid to be in this section are there for the race At this point I Am just going to stop bitching and embrace the suck Would Not they be able to just stand up and be basically trackside I do not understand all the hate Great planning lol In Austria general admission tickets for the whole weekend are 110€ and you can literally see half the track from there There Is cars Only in Miami lol I imagine they will be up against the fence The people buying 1000 “beach” seats are not there to see the race The race is just the back drop to this particular social event for them Its not a place to see the race but to be seen at the race How will they not be able to see the car if the track is right beside them Cannot they just stand up during the actual race The prices for the race are ridiculous Those are being seen not to actually see the race My first race 2000 bought GA seat was 40 feet from the cars at 200MPH with perfect view Oh yeah ticket was 30 Ahh the good ole days cannot believe i just said that I Have never felt the urge to go watch a GP live Extreme cases like this aside will not you just get a better view of things at home its not about the money its about sending a message Oh you think people whom book those seats are there to see the cars But those insta photos though 🤦 Why do people think anyone paying 1000 for hospitality tickets are going to watch the race on the track They will watch it on a TV at the bar If they watch it at all Circuit de Barcelona GA ticket £140 Return flight hotel £380 5 night Yes please 😎😎😎 I can sense some Fyre festival vibes for those seats 😂 Most people going to this event arnt there to see the cars Imagine paying 1000 and see a wall But the people who pay 1000 for F1 probably do not even car for the F1 they will be in the VIP area and drinking champagner and eating during the race anyway While I am sitting at the track 247 Friday to Sunday in Spielberg with my 100€ ticket to see F3 F2 and Porsche and of course F1 This year it is over 100€ for the first time let us hope that is real sand But you are missing the point everyone can see YOU 😎💰💸 I Have been to 3 races and you can barely see any cars at any track Having lived in Miami for 4 years I can say this whole track and event is the epitome of Miami Flashy overpriced likely sub par quality Welcome to Miamithey do not care about the race its about showing off you paid for the seats I live in Miami its the most fake city I have ever seen cannot wait to get back out Games gone no that would have to be risen for 23 meters but for that the safetyfence is to low Thank God COTA is a proper race course There are multiple giant screens on track Let Us be clear The best way to view the actual GP is in front of your TV or your PC if you are using F1 TV account This is an experience you are next to F1 cars there is an electric mood beer food you name it its redicolus its a bad fake beach and it would be ears killer I Am torn I want good racing because I will watching at home But all this fake lifestyle in the middle of a parking lot is making me sick and I do not want F1 returning and doing this all over again Looks like a good spot to nap and have a beer Is this next to the fake water That Will complete the vibe All these people will be watching the race on a giant screen somewhere nearby The actual race is for ambiance deleted Why would I want to seat on sand if there is no beach Like sand is the bad thing about going to the beach which is what people who cannot afford a swimming pool do I thougt the yachts on fake water already did not make much sense but this is another level HardRock sucks This was a problem when Singapore hosted there first race So much better off booking a high rise room for the weekend and watching from there Miami GP taking inspiration from Fyre I Am sure things like this will get sorted for next year at least They Are obviously a bit rushed this year This shit is turning into the new Fyre Festival Its laughable If it is this fake I cannot imagine what Vegas will be like How can you fuck up so badly lol Yeah not many people attending the Miami gp care about f1 That is ok the people buying those seats are not interested in the cars or racing anyway Man as a new American F1 fan it really is a smack to the face I do not understand how F1 is expected to grow if they keep catering to a wealthier fanbase Do I like more races coming to the US Hell yeah Do I like that two of them are now going to be in super tourist spots that the average Joe will struggle to afford Hell no Does F1 as an organization want to grow or are they content with getting money from the rich deleted As an American I am already hating this GP There is a second floor in the beachclub If that cost more I do not know Then again its not much to slag Was at Imola and they really do not do all they can either to ensure a good viewing experience F1 should really work with all the tracks a but over the next years to try improve it Is the sand real at least Cannot you just walk around and go watch somewhere else like at football games I always go to the fan zone party areas and watch from standing bar area Nobody buying those seats cares what they are able to see only that they will be seen Mrbeast new video place lmao the target customer are the celebs who barely give a fuck about the race anyway so it works out going to sell out either way most likely will not be able to see cars Oh they will when Carlos finds his way to the closest thing to gravel that this track has Those seats are ment to be sold to influencers not real racing fans Those seats are to be seen in not to see from Something that caught my attention when Esfand the twitch streamer went to COTA was how many people did not come from racing rather they came for the experience Cool people vibes drinks and watch cars too This is just an extension of attrack experience trying to attract that audience This is how influencer based marketing works see revolve fest Coachella for example Are we remotely surprised The race organizers only care how it looks on tv Same with the people sitting there They just want to be seen there You are paying to share a space with beautiful rich people Good deal I suppose if you want followers They have places like this in Montreal too It is not a Miami or US thing It is all and that is fine Let those people enjoy that experience I will say being on track level and close is pretty cool too It is just a different way to experience the show Is the sand even real That is why I always go in the back I know Indy is considered low brow and all but for 1000 I am taking my father to Indy 500 and sitting with a great view of the final turn and startfinish You could also toss in the hotel and rental car for FridayMonday and one of our fight tickets from Minneapolis in that 100000 I really hope it rains lol Bring on the chaos Is not there a whole beech club They can probably watch from that deck I cannot wait for a rain to down pour on these seats… Are the races in Europe this ridiculously expensive That track and its design around it is pure chaos Cool spot but unless you are on a high pedestal you will will not be able to see shit Looks like they will see plenty And moreso than that they look like what is on show for the grandstands when there is no action I Those corners That would be so awkward to me to have thousands looking across at a few dozen in those beach chairs lol The F1 snobbery on here is something else If these seats are advertised as an up close and personal F1 experience and you cannot see shit then that is bullshit do not assume it is just women with fake breasts here for a holiday and an Instagram photo I would pay a premium for beach seats where I could watch the race with a good site line If that is what these people were expecting then this is really shitty for them and you all should not be a bunch of cunts What am I missing Why will not they be able to see over that wall This GP is a becoming a failure before it even starts I can see it now the youtube mini documentaries about the nightmare Miami GP of 2022 Fuuuuuck Miami They are there to be seen not to see the race Looks like they will be able to see just fine People there do not watch the race anyway they just want to be seen I would not worry about it the people that are going to spend tens of thousands for those stupid seats probably will not be able to tell you who Michael Schumacher or Ayrton Senna were either Maybe they will remember Nicky Louder from that movie Thor was in They Will be looking at their phones all race anyway They will taste and see sand its crazy how they are in Miami but those dumbasses could not get the race right next to the water Meanwhile we have races in Monaco So really was F1 just being cheap for MIA Lol would have been a cool opportunity to have cameras on the trackside barriers feeding to screens immediately behind crudely making an invisible wall I can go to MidOhio and see the Indy race for like 60 The Miami race has just lost the plot Americans love overpriced sub par quality let them have it in peace Better bring your own hyraulic ramp to see over the fence xD You can feel the speed Duh Bold of you to assume they care I get free tickets from some guy I know for the red bull ring every year He sponsors something or whatever No idea So many people are making out everybody who bought these tickets are there for social media likes People can be richer than average Joe and still have just a big of interest in F1 as average Joe It could be that they are taking their partners are are keeping all parties happy It could just be that they like the idea of this Let people enjoy what they enjoy… Really cool I like it I feel like Zhou ended up being the perfect 2 driver for Alfa He has a very similar demeanor to Bottas A bit quiet but seemingly a happy guy Keeping his head down and just have great drives for his first season I keep putting money on him to get in the points Siiick Really starting to like zhou to be honest That is a nice helmet Wow I love this Danny Ric vibes This is the one Starting to really like this kid Seems like he might have potential Cool helmet too Like it alot Cool helmet good dude It has probably been said somewhere but why do all drivers have a special Miami livery Commercially interesting of course and it really looks like they were heavily influenced by a kind of blueprint of palm trees and happiness Everybody get up its time to slam now 🎶 my man included more basketball references than sponsor logos lol Why does he have a busted knock off bugs bunny cartoon Is it a logo in not familiar with That is one fucking sick lid man Gaat damn That is really a slick design vibrant and really pops out at you Aside from the playoffs being in full swing anyone know the deal with both Lando and Zhou having basketball features Dope RIP Kobe What a great helmet design Zhou Hey can I put Lola Bunny on my helmet Alfa We have Lola Bunny at home The Lola Bunny at home They all kind of look the same Such a cool helmet and I Am liking the basketball rabbit adding a nice cool touch Soo good The colors pop so well And the sponsor logos are not overbearing 🔥🔥 A Lisa Frank binder with stickers F1 Helmet Edition Does he sell them on scale Can someone tell me how hes holding the helmet on the first pic Is this guy a magician This is fucking sick Sweet design He actually put his Fursona on it The fucking mad lad Guys I think he likes basketball Love the space jam reference I like the “totally not basketball Bugs Bunny from space jam due to international copyright law” on the side nice touch How do I get a useable replica of this What does the Chinese word mean on the basketball part Very cool Maybe a bit cluttered but its a lovely departure from the typical racing helmet designs All this Miami stuff is going to severely damage my wallet With little dipshit and daddy gone Haas seems like an entertaining and marketable team This is great news The idea is not ludicrous the company appears to have stability A 50 million or so marketing deal may bot be that outside their expansion plans and budgets 5his is definetly not a rich energy situation The KMAG effect Looking into their company sounds like a pretty solid sponsorship Probably not going to be life changing for Haas based on the size but who gives a fuck Glad to see Haas getting some new sponsorship Haas going to the moon With a name like Lunar I was so worried this was another crypto sponsorship Thankfully its an actual bank that provides actual products and services I am sure this will work out So much positivity surrounding Haas at the moment Adding to that they have a very respectable package this year getting new sponsors on bord must have become a million times easier Huh They had their logo on the car at previous weekends already why they announce it just now Will it also be on F1TV With the announcement on sky I was hoping something in the US would pop up I will watch ESPN will broadcast live coverage of all qualifying and race sessions across their portfolio of channels including ESPN2 ESPN3 ESPNU and ESPNEWS Very surprised ESPN is actually putting W series on their flagship stations My initial reaction was ok sure they will just throw it on ESPN and make people pay to stream it Nice I Have always wanted to be able to watch W Series here I Am in too Good job Some great broadcasting deals for the W series lately Looks like more Magisterial Messi replays on BeIn Great news Excited to watch The only thing I see on the ESPN app right now is the Spanish language broadcast Hope they just have not gotten that squared away yet This is great news Anyone from this group have a good shot at F1 Fuck yes thank you Anything to support these women Yay I cannot for the life of me understand why F1 cannot seem to work it out for it to be on F1TV… seems a bit of a nobrainer Are there pictures of the cocaine chicane Look at all the shadows on the road The surface does not look flat at all Cannot wait to see HAM bobblehead makes an appearance on the main straight Curious as to why they have the last few starting boxes at an angle Would Not it be easier and more fair if these were straight Or is there a required distance between the track edge and the grid box for crews to work ad such Hold up I work for one of these companies and have not been offered hospitality tickets Resignation incoming It seems so strange to associate AutoNation and Gainbridge with F1 and not Indycar Aside from that I Have been curious all year to see what Michael Schumachers cruise line is like This is probably the first time since the 70s or something that a Grand Prix has these many partners on the same track at the same time We got to bet on which barrier sponsors will Latifi hit first Space in Sector 3 for Reddit Not too late So no zoom zoom zoom this weekend c I like this It means no part of the track looks similar so its easy to tell where the drivers are Rear will snap into Pirelli barriers If the promoters got their way it would be Lewis Hamilton is going through the Heineken 00 corner presented by GEICO Get the best insurance in the whole country Glad to see Mick sponsoring a part of the track There needs to be a Carvana sponsorship boarding That is where Latifi will crash carrying on for Jimmie Johnson I am surprised by an extent to which this community embraces sponsors You guys are genuinely excited about them and their ads I find it surprising because personally I despise every kind of advertising that is shoved down my throat and I actively block it from my consciousness Like I do not acknowledge who the sponsor of given team or event is and you will not make me I am baffled by the fact that so many people have directly opposite point of view on this Why do you care What about the space between Gainbridge and Aramco I am still not convinced Gainbridge is a real company Every track has a sponsor on every wall and corner but we have to complain this week because “AMERICA BAD” huh Ok Fuck Cryptocom I would rather see a Wells Fargo ad Its like neoliberalism had a bender a threw up a F1 race track How is this shit content This is the most american thing i have ever seen in F1 These are the things that worry me about F1 in America everything is going to be sponsored Was not expecting to see my former employer here Will be a good way to see where the drivers are though Why is there a nonalcoholic Are we in Saudi Arabia or what Gainbridge eh Hmm So mow we get 17 unnecessary pop up adverts each lap 😂🤣😂 Is it me or do more indycar sponsors have placement here than cota How much more expensive is cota brand placement in comparison to miami cryptocom will drop billions on some cool shit for fun and mfs will still willingly use their service Like you are being robbed by millennials right now lmao i cannot wait for this race My f1 team on f1 manager1996 after I start getting sponsors Still do not understand why MSC cruises have not tied up Mick It is a natural fit Surely this is detrimental to the sponsors themselves When there is a million different sponsors around the track they get drowned out individually Ricciardo showed up at last year’s race dressed as a cowboy and did preshow donuts in a vintage Chevrolet stock car Later in the weekend COTA hosted the world Spameating championship How to get Americans to care aye American here for the comments 🍿 The posh stodgy European sport When your editor tells you to add in some British sounding adjectives Just wanted to say Very well written article For those who plan to read it NASCAR once tried to get a certain fanbase interested in their sport it worked but to the cost of all the die hard fans who felt betrayed on the sport that had left them That certain fanbase then left and NASCAR was without many of its die hard audience and without the audience it tried to get I worry that this is the way F1 is going now and in 10 or 20 years it will have been super popular and then drop off the radar well care for a minute not longer watch Who knew all they had to do was increase ticket prices to 1200 plus dollars F1 needs to give some of us older American fans credit for having to explain what F1 was to people for so long 😩 Anxiously awaits read out of stereotypes of an otherwise diverse socially and culturallyrich OECD nonauthoritatian nation of nearly 330M people By creating fake drama I do not understand why all these websites keep claiming that f1 ‘has cracked’ the USA There is on average 1 million viewers per race For a country with over 300 million people this is not that much Americans need a driver for the popularity to rise even further I understand why but its funny Following a driver because you share the same nationality not his skills or character God I hope America does not start rubbing off on F1 but I fear it already has F1 was is and likely will be European centric sport just like IndyCar NASCAR NBA and other US based series Teams have factories there karting is better there as well Despite Liberty push for the US F1 still has more fans in Europe despite gaining tracks in America 2 more in Miami and Las Vegas Neither European fans come to for example Indy and say that change to look more European I really hate articles like this because it makes me fight the urge to defend myself with Not ALL of us are like this commentary but reading those comments are often equally as exhausting I do think there is a disassociation between the average American consumer and what is being marketed to us We are extremely aware of how on the nose the strategies are to reach us as the target audience and at least for the people I know were all typically just as embarrassed by the lack of nuance What are we to do I Am not going to NOT watch a race just because its got this ridiculous pandering but at the same time F1 will look at a successful event and go See All this stuff we did is what the Americans wanted WWE style contrived title battles and results Not worth it Thought it was a decent analysis of the American marketing machine churning right now around the Miami GP regardless of personal feelings re Americanization of the sportmedia around it Cannot wait for all races to be hosted in Middle East and America Did they put guns on the cars Just like everything else they had to dumb it down for them to understand Bless their hearts 😆 “Why do the LA Clippers trade for 2 billion The NBA is a great sport but it does not have a global reach and the Clippers do not have 20 world championships to its name So why are they worth four times McLaren” Zak Brown He has a very good point Benchmarking F1 teams against US sports team is just the first step they ought to compare themselves to Premier League football teams one day if not being the benchmark themselves for other global sports I mean F1 races are exclusively international in its reach read world championship F1 pride itself as elite and glamorous so why sell themselves cheap the advanced tech involved and amount of employees each team employs are mindnumbingly high and they are highly skilled to boot The skys the limit As an east coast American the best part of F1 are the 9am Sunday morning start times Wake up get some breakfast watch the race and then it is over by lunch and have the whole day left I actually do not like races in America for that exact same reason That is truly an AWESOME helmet design Alonso has really nailed the use of the blue and the pink so perfectly Gorgeous Why the fuck could not BWT let them have this pink on their livery Looks waaaayy better than their bland shitty version of pink The car should have used this 2 tones of pink and blue Damned corporate colors Such a cool helemt and then there is all the BWT crap all over it I Am starting to hate this company I like Very cool helmet Nailed it with the palm trees and the lifeguard stations It is Miami You got to’ have ‘them The most authentic touch however is that green circle on the back It is a reference to the very rare “green flash” phenomenon that you might be able to see from the deep Keys when the sun can be seen setting into the ocean That is brilliant Brilliant Love it Some other angles Miami pink I like 1010 but where is KIMOA best helmet of the weekend BWT is comedy The publicity must work for them However Not that I noticed Skipped over their water filtration for the upcoming home build Probably because I am so tired of seeing their pink everywhere I cannot honestly believe I am saying this as I love Miami vice colors so much But damn I am tired of seeing it already helmets posters everything shout out alpha for their poster though Very cool design Hot shit The blue and pink combination we wanted but did not get on alpine So this is where Alpines v a p o r w a v e aesthetic is Holy fuck Now that is vaporwave Alpine West coast times Practice 1 56 1130a 1230p Practice 2 56 230 330 Practice 3 57 1000a 1100a Qualifying 57 100p 200p Sunday Race 1230p Not fully sure this

never seen Geoblocked videos on Twitter before G fucking G Sky Sports lol that accent is just as foreign to Miami as his Aussie accent Years later and Danny still qualifies behind Valtteri Absolutely love it A little known fact is that every Aussie gets Honorary American status if they want it I hope we get a focused trying to beat his teammate Daniel this weekend The least funny driver on the grid Most australians do not even see him as one of us anymore anyway They can have him Honestly I do not I find it super annoying You mean the best photo of your life according to crofty Opening party What else does a race weekend consist of that I have no idea I hate that I cut off Seb in this pic he is always been my favorite I also got some good shots of Lewis George and Charles but I do not have an Imgur account and I do not want to spam the sub with posts These guys fullon looking like the hottest new boys band the New Kids on the Grid Look how happy they are Love to see it 4 wdc in one picture Get yourself a man that looks at you like Zak does at Lando Everyone on that photo looks genuinely happy to be there…good call from F1 to race in Miami Gardens… Christian still loves Seb Were cameras allowed for nonjournalists or was it phonecams only enjoy the show AND the race on sunday USA greets from an austrian F1 fan as on every race sunday my friends and i will watch from my place on sunday evening our timezone A whole episode about how Lando hates Daniel so much he would not even let him stand with the team at the opening party is coming Big dad energy from Christian and zaklook at the way zak looks at lando and Christian looks at seb Like the proudest dads out there Poor Kev at the back lol Great pic Hope you enjoyed the party The livestreams posted on F1s official YouTube channel if anyones interested in checking it out Why did they need rush the intros was the music talent on some crazy contract to perform precisely at a certain time Kevin peeking from the BG Mick seems to gravitate towards Seb Let Us be real everyone was just there to see Latifi The fact that you got a glimpse of the goat is the reason it is a great pic If they are all there already its kind of strange not doing the official media on the thursday nice pics What is up with Ricciardos shirt Does he wear one size bigger I was way too focused on it when watching the opening party last night Landos polo fits him just fine it looks like Carlos looks very relieved that the sand is outside the track this time Kmag Podium Confirmed Look at him scheming plotting Dang Latifi looks like he has a huge head in this shot I watched it on YouTube and there were only a few fans relatively speaking probably less than 1k you can tell the production was trying to show as little of the crowd as possible Zhou joining mcclaren confirmed s I scrolled thru you are post history that realistic batboy post is abnormal So what is the over under on the number of drivers who test positive for Covid next week I posted a few more pics here is a link The beaming smiles What Daniel so happy about Pursuing hobbies Original Res Photo Well this is odd LOL Only Bloomberg would think that ridiculously expensive entry prices are something worth celebrating The article is actually a very good read BB does quality journalism How did they do it Netflix Actually a really solid article Really great article If you do not want to read it more highlights the differences between how Bernie approached F1 vs how Liberty approaches managing the sport Netflix was a shot in the arm but if there was no F1TV or social media presence the sport really would not be as popular as it is now DTS made it more approachable but Libertys management has made it consumable Love the dig on NASCAR lmao Looking like a Nintendo Power cover from the 90s Ferrari about to add caltrop compartments to their rear end That drawing does not show any difference between old and new airflow It only points out where the change happened Am I missing smth SMH man i just want carlos to finish the race As someone who is a total F1 noob and new to the sport it blows my mind that that little of a change can be the deciding performance factor of who potentially wins Yes Tighter fights is all we need Hope Mercedes solve their issues faster so that there will be a three way fight I hope Mercedes upgrades work as well It would be awesome to see 3way battle between all 3 top teams Always mildly amusing to me that they are doing over 300kmh whilst seated as if they are in a lounge chair Original Res Photos Photo Photo 2 Photo 3 I know it is been designed safely but man it looks fucking terrifying that the fuel is directly behind the driver like that This is actually a drawing of Kimi You can easily tell by the lack of drink in the cockpit One of the best follows on F1 twitter Have learned a lot from his posts Ill be really disappointed if there is no cocks Damn that seating position gives a whole different perspective This explains the Bottass all the blood congregates in drivers’ posteriors It really shows how tightly packed they are in there with all the seating and padding around them and also see the roll over area that the halo and the rollover hoop create What Is the FIA safety camera used for Is there any footage available I mean yeah for safety obviously but in which circumstances for example The seat is lighter than I would have expected Probably no padding either people do not realise the amount of core strength required to be sat in this position for 2 hours with the performance of those cars go try and sit in this position yourself for a small insight No pee bags ಠಠ And a driver…no arrows point to a driver 😂 Do Not some teams have their drinking system in the nose forgot the steering wheel Mercedes logging on to watch this Explained again Buchan Sport strikes again in his running series about 2022 floor concepts I do not get why this post is so unpopular The video tries to explain a working theory which is does rather eloquently B Sport is still hypothesizing but as a very fresh exF1 aerodynamicist his musings are a lot more informed and interesting to watch than most youtube channels regarding the technical side of F1 this year Good theories This just looks like circuit specific upgrade We will know if they brought any upgrades to mitigate porpoising tomorrow when they have to detail the upgrades for the show and tell At Mercedes they are convinced that they have found the keys to the lack of competitiveness of the W13 and are working hard to try to revive the fortunes of the World Constructors champion team Brackleys team was sure they had a car with extreme aerodynamics that should have given them a one second advantage per lap The facts have shown that this was not the case and on the contrary Lewis Hamilton and George Russell found themselves as the third force with a Silver Arrow that pays a gap of six to seven tenths per lap from Red Bull and Ferrari For the Mercedes technicians the main difficulties derive from the exaggerated frequency of porpoising that brings the nefarious hopping almost all the way into the corners while on the Ferrari it runs out much earlier as the top speeds drop While we wait to see what Mike Elliotts engineers have prepared for the fifth seasonal event there is a weight reduction of about 3 kg we have to observe the front wing of the W13 which was designed for the Miami straights almost 2 kilometers long The image of Giorgio Piola taken in the paddock highlights how the adjustable flap has been redesigned to reduce drag in particular the incidence in the portion that goes from the nose to the support brackets has been reduced while the trailing edge it has been reshaped with clearly visible material removals that make the profile very shaped Its around one tenth of a second if I am not mistaking right Hopium incoming I said it yesterday but I hope Mercedes can challenge at the front this season Not because I want them to win another championship but because having three teams compete at the top is better than two If Alpine and McLaren or any other team can also get to the top that would be awesome as well but it seems like Mercedes is the closest as it stands 3kg equates to about a tenth a lap Given the margins of the midfield group that is quite helpful For context a tenth would have seen George move up one in Bahrain Lewis into at least Q2 and George up one again in Saudi No change in Australia but Lewis would have been a fraction behind Norris Nothing would change in Imola thanks to changing conditions and noncompleted laps in red flags Obviously this can be negated by other teams losing weight but it will make a difference in isolation Nevermind the porpoising Hopium for myself 3 kg The whole team slaves away to shave off every last bit of weight meanwhile the guys on the front wing are like ‘our bad we thought we needed a sack of spuds in there’ But they still have the porpoise which is going to hurt them alot this weekend They Have taken the sandbags off boys Its happening Mercedes 12 incoming Wings are actually the same its the adjusters on the end that are smaller Haha sandbags 3kg weight reduction is insane considering front wing only weight about 10kg I do not quite believe this cuz some says Mercedes was just 1kg over the 798kg minimum weight Although they make this 3kg reduction they still need to adding 2kg somewhere else This may change the weight balance of whole car which may give a little bit advantage I guess Cannot wait until this somehow makes the car worse Finally can get ahead of Gasly or can he Let Us hope they get knocked out in Q1 again like in Jeddah 👌 This is the same wing from AUS seems to me That Is a decent amount of weight to drop Although if the porpoising situation is not improved by this then its not really going to change much new floor too At first I thought you meant they had unloaded aero which would actually probably help with porpoising Taking 3kg off the very front end must do a ton to help with understeer but Id be worried about even more oversteer out of the corners I was expecting to also see a very heavy zippo in this photo… Miami has so many slow bumpy corners the porpoising will cripple them this weekend What are they going to light up with a 3kg lighter A lap around this circuit seems fun I do not care what anyone says this track layout has a good mix of nearly everything you want in a track Tricky apex turns 5816 Straights long enough to pass on Heavy braking zones at the end of the straights Tight technical sections that may not be good for overtakes but punishes mistakes The only thing it lacks is elevation changes No porpoising This game is literally unplayable SMH Also that offcenter She Will logo on the Ferrari halo looks odd I know its because they cannot show alcohol advertising so they removed the logo on the other side But it would look better if they centered the She Will logo Love the turn complex under the overpass A little up a little down a little wiggle I bet we will see big time gaps there seems ripe for little errors I did not buy F1 2021 because I knew it would be the exact same game as the 2019 and 2020 version I hoped the 22 game would be a brand new game with new physics graphics game engine and hopefully new netcode for multiplayer but this looks like a freaking reshade of 2021 again ffs The circuit looks awesome Seems quite long but very well done We Have heard the Mercedes and Honda engines in the game time for Ferrari Not abusing the kerbs this is not charles Is it me or does the marina have real water in the game Its like a mix of Sepang Baku and Singapore I mean it is Charles it has to be hot Right This circuit is perfect for the redbull i expect another 12 You mean DLC from F1 2017 for price of 80 Euros got it Garbage That area under the bridge looks so clunky and ripe for a big crash Love the turn complex under the overpass A little up a little down a little wiggle I bet we will see big time gaps there seems ripe for little errors Probably an extremely stupid question on my part but will they actually develop different car models for the vastly differing cars on this year’s field instead of just the same generic show car with mildly incorrect liveries each time How hard is it to get new engine sounds I do not understand There are so many engine sound mods on racedepartment for other games made by people and a whole game just keeps the same engine sounds for 23 years I fucking hate codemasters Aw damn its just a repainted showcar This livery seems like it would look amazing on an AT03 While teams are scraping liveries off Alpha tauri is recycling that paint because you know environment Oh an art car that would be so cool to see them use it for the race Direct link to Video here HQ Possibly a one off livery Its going to be another NFT by Mr Gasly Brand new factory and Windtunnel in 2024 Audi will be very happy Rather that than them taking over McLaren Aston MartinAudi Stroll admits discussions News ASTON MARTINAUDI STROLL ADMITS DISCUSSIONS Lawrence Stroll has confirmed that he has spoken with Audi which is interested in taking over the F1 business and said he is very happy with the collaboration with Mercedes Fabiano Polimeni 20 hours ago The presentation of financial results during the first quarter of the year coincided with the announcement of Aston Martins new CEO Amedeo Felisa replaces Tobias Moers and together with another former Ferrari Roberto Fedeli head of the technical department since June will have to lead Lawrence Strolls brand towards the growth and development phase in the electrification era The conference call with investors however served not only to present the Q1 results but also to comment on the rumors very solid of an Aston Martin approached by Audi AUDI IN FORMULA 1 WITH ITS OWN TEAM The scenario is that of the German brands entry into Formula 1 from 2026 They are working on several solutions where the way in the case of Porsche is better defined and looks at the collaboration with Red Bull The track that led to the acquisition of McLaren by Audi seems to have cooled at the same time increased the odds on a possible purchase of the Aston Martin team along with rumors that also look in the direction of Williams Racing and others to Sauber Motorsport STROLL CONFIRMS RUMORS Lawrence Stroll confirmed the discussions he had with Audi in a brief statement in response to Bank of America explained If we have been approached by Audi yes Are we very happy with our collaboration with Mercedes yes The world of Formula 1 is full of these stories The collaboration with MercedesAMG is very close under the industrial profile and an Audi entry in Formula 1 from the Aston Martin door would be configured with its own team to take over structures and registration as well as benefits of the Pact of Concord Aston Stroll has launched an important investment plan called however to produce results that so far have been absolutely disappointing in the commitment of the team in Formula 1 Strolls declarations have been understated admitting discussions with Audi and obviously supporting the technical collaboration with the power unit supplier Mercedes Could it be the bells of an attractive offer from Audi to convince Stroll to leave the scene in Formula 1 In taking over and saving Aston Martin in 2020 Formula 1 has been identified by the Canadian businessman as a key showcase for building a recognized global brand and player in the luxury performance sector I remember a Beyond the Grid cannot remember who where they made the point that establishing a truly new team is a bastard None of the good folk want to work for you it could last three years and be a disaster Rather than facilities 90 of the value of F1 teams is the people So I think Audi will be better off paying through the nose for something like Sauber Sounds like the best option for Audi Aston Martin is based in the UK and build a completely new facility Would be great to see a seat open up again Honestly the team was performing better under VJM Micromanagement is killing this team I rather prefer the full take over OMG Vettels 5th WDC in an Audi As long as it is not McLaren Please at least have it be a full on takeover then I cannot stand daddy Stroll much less when he might actually win “Have we been approached by Audi Yes Are we very happy with our collaboration with Mercedes Yes The world of Formula 1 is full of these stories” This is what he actually said you guys want stroll gone so badly you believe Every headline Bye Bye Daddy Stroll do not forget to take Lance or let the door hit you on the way out This is great news The sooner the Strolls are out of F1 the better for all This guy is looking for someone who can solve the teams technical problems with him constantly looking over their shoulders Total micromanaging piece of shit That would be great we could see a full german team in mick seb or nico if they went full german in the marketing How does this work with the Mercedes ties Aston Martin has How does this work commercially There Is bound to be some overlap between their road car markets This would make way more sense than McLaren For one thing McLaren has complex ownership They Have sold off or licensed out so many parts of the business that trying to buy all of that back to absorb the brand would be a massive headache Given the amount of money being pumped into Aston Martin both as an F1 team and car manufacturer a lot of the world Audi would need to do is already in place combined with a team that is historically pretty damn good at saving a few quid If my understanding is correct what that is doing is basically prevent car from going any lower then it should I think Ted discussed this briefly in the notebook Its interesting because largely speaking you are better off with packages of upgrades in 2022 because its more efficient use of resourcesunless its something like this which unlocks what the car is really meant to be doing and is actually a very small upgrade If you think of the 2005 McLaren a very small tweak unleashed the car I think where folk are getting confused is the idea that Mercs problems are the latter If my understanding is correct what that is doing is basically prevent car from going any lower then it should Finally Merc can fix its porpoising This is why I love f1 and the precision engineering that comes with it It just looks like a few slots of carbon fiber but the change can either put you near the front or be lapped several times Driver61 video that explains this When we first saw porpoising in preseason testing the trivial fixes people were commenting about included this one Active suspension bumpersskates etc I believe there were even specific comments from either Braun a team principal or aero SME iirc saying that those would not fix the issue It seems like we just had a definitive article like this saying it was actually the rear suspension so it just feels like this is ongoing clickbait to further leverage this topic to drive traffic So my idea of a zero height floor actually kind of was right and could work just not the whole floor obviously Ferrari will bring this upgrade this race let us see if this may help Last year i had a game with my family where everyone was given 2 drivers at random and points were awarded by track positions gainedlost At first it got very hectic but started getting interesting once everyone started getting engine penalties Also it was a rollercoaster of emotions wishing for your favorite driver to start low on the grid to give you lots of possible points but at the same time wanting to have your favorite driver start high up in the grid because you want to see them in the podium Would it be possible for you to share the Sheets link I have been maintaining a Google Sheet of my own to classify the race results and the standings just for fun And I am pretty sure I have done a lot of unnecessary work to make it since I am not too good with SheetsExcel Would love to take a look at yours That is pretty cool makes it a lot more fun thanks for sharing Any chance you share the templates if we wanted to replicate Fun fact more people were at the soccer stadium for Ocon’s visit and there was not even a game on then at the Marlins game where Max and Checo threw out the first pitch Pink does suit him a lot so weird to see him so close to home Higuain and Ocon swap deal here we go Poor Esteban meeting some shit soccer players while Gasly was having diner with Jordan i mean i do not think an european have to go to US to visit a football team It like econ ring his manager and said everyone is meeting some celebs hook me up with someone as well lol I assume its a safety thing to slow the cars down before entry but its a shame that it will probably increase the pitstop delta and make a two stop strategy less attractive Let me put a tenner on a Latifi or Mick DNF Original Res Photo Please not Carlos please not Carlos I Am Going To it looks too tight for your everyday road car much less an f1 car that has the slow speed turning ability of a 200ft long cargo ship I get it could just be the angle of the photo but it looks very tight Coulthard is having flashbacks This pit entry with the possibility of a classic Florida flash flood thunderstorms mid race someone could easily end their race there and if multiple people are pitting at once it can because proper carnage That reminds me of the Le Mans Pit Entry Chicane in a way it will test the drivers no doubt to see who can master this tricky chicane We Have seen crashes at or in pit entry before Id be intrigued to see if we get that here Since when is Latifi called “somebody” No gravel trap so Hamilton is safe Everyone staring at Latifi be like 👀 Who will cut it the most I do not like these long time loss pitlanes Since the speed limit reduction 2 stops have been so difficult so we end up with 1 stop and lots of tyre saving The drivers are lucky that it will be dry slow button on What happens if you cut the track in the pitlane Penalty Well it has tarmac when you miss the entry of the chicane so where is the problem Just because were in America does not mean we suddenly have to stop putting turns on our racetracks Latifi is going to make 1 fanbase extremely happy and another extremely upset then it seems cough Latifi cough deleted China 2007 is without a doubt in my top 10 F1 moments of all time along with Senna crashing Prost out at Suzuka in 1990 and all the Bose headphones that died last year whenever Toto did not get his way Should be long enough for people to forget about Daniel About yeah Noice Back up to a full 12 team grid Aka the Peroni ad with F1 car in it This is really bad i am going to the car is the least obvious thing on this This is feeling more of a Peroni advert than an Aston Martin Poster to me Well it is certainly another poster from the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Peroni F1 Team P E R O N I It lacks finesse not enough refined gradation highlights subtle texture Peroni bottle is too dull and looks faceted which it is not Overly saturated magenta orb behind the car is slightly overpowering does not quite match her lip colour Face looks straight out of Shutterstock Its basically a bit pony I am being harsh I Am tired tough titty toenails The car looks strange particularly the sidepod BSpec leak by Peroni This sucks So who is drinking 0 alcohol beer Does this mean vettel has a name ready for the car She reminds me of Flo from Progressive Is that the same Nastro Azzurro that sponsor Valentino Rossi during his early years in Motog GTA Vice City Focus and have the girl’s face as most of the poster have the drink near her lips as if she is drinking it and have the car in the reflection of her glasses since she is zoomed in there will be more of the car and it will not look so stupid and transparent as a slap job marketing ad This is not a race poster this is a beer ad Ah yes the real focus of this GP This is goodas a Peroni poster Bad F1 poster though Will it be painted to look like the ocean Ocon coming close to nando this week possibly Ocon podium incoming Allonsy A shame there is so much sponosor names flying around The man has good taste in helmets Source Quality of the picture is unfortunately not so good but its the only one I could find of the helmet That Is what the alpine livery should have been I thought the gp was in miami Maimi👀 I cannot believe how crowded his helmet looks Sponsors sponsors sponsors If the helmet was green Id call it Chick Hicks I also dislike BWT demanding the drivers to pink it up I miss the distinct Fernando look we have come to love Love the helmet But are all the helmets this weekend about to look the same D Gasly Max and now Alonso all look pretty similar Going with the Miami Beach look that looks good Miami Vice colours and palm trees Muy original I see they went with the vaporwave theme How original Nothing beats Maimi If only the Alpine looked like this It seems as if everyone is bringing a new helmet design to Miami I feel like I need to buy a Hawaiian shirt or something just to watch the race Great stuff OP Secondly do you expect any copyright issues going forward You should absolutely expect issues may arise especially if one of F1s broadcasters decides they want to do similar videos or features Yep good stuff ta This is awesome ill definitely check out this channel after races You should add text describing what is happening in the race Like Max approaching backmarkers or Leclerc slow pitstop cool job Repost Wait is that an American football player statue This event was so akward Ngl looks like a WWE WrestleMania entrance stage They carry on doing events like this and generating the excitement I bet they will put the crown jewel label onto Miami in no time Bottas This feels a far too dramatic headline for what Brown said in a podcast Ricciardo has a contract through till the end of 2023 and they are just waiting until later this year to start negotiations and talks They Have got time and hes got time All these rumours swirling because McLaren is testing OWard and Herta as mandated by F1 for the two rookie testing sessions seem a bit dramatic for the moment Tomorrow Norris extends hit contract till 28 Always good to anticipate early People need to chill Results in races they both have finished this year Lando 15553 Danny146618 He was destroyed in 2021 but is comfortably matching Norris this year diffusor damage due to racing incident albeit his fault it was just close racing into a blind corner in the rain and not really indicative of poor performance McLaren in no hurry to sign Ricciardo Do Not commit too early Remy Ramjiawan Thursday 5 May 2022 0757 McLaren boss Zak Brown says Daniel Ricciardo is not sure of a place with the Wokingbased team after 2023 The smiling Australian had a volatile debut season at McLaren but is also in 2022 slower than teammate Lando Norris Ricciardo was brought in for his experience in the top of the field In his time at Red Bull Racing the Australian was still able to pick up the occasional victory When Max Verstappen joined in 2016 he was sometimes able to outpace even the 2021 world champion Nevertheless the overall trend surrounding Ricciardos arrival at McLaren is currently disappointing The Australian still has a contract until 2023 and therefore enough time to prove himself but there are also alternatives for the team from Woking Alternatives Brown states in conversation with Formula1com We have one more season together after this year and of course we are already thinking about the long term Whether that will be with Ricciardo or without the Australian Brown does not say He does hint however that there are plenty of alternatives ready We will test with Pato OWard and Colton Herta he says Brown wants to postpone the decision on whether or not to extend the contract with Ricciardo Its best not to commit to these things too early and were not in a hurry he explains of the eighttime race winners tenure Ricciardo feeling better Apart from the contract Brown sees Ricciardo doing better at McLaren this year Yes he definitely is His races are going better and he has won something in qualifying as well the 50yearold American says The man who took Carlos Sainzs spot at McLaren is also a year on Hes not quite comfortable in the car yet but his bond with Lando is more than good He has also got to know the team very well Brown explains After last seasons dip in form Brown is therefore pleased that Ricciardo has found his way up the ladder Of course we are happy that he is back on top himself he concludes Why would they hurry There Is plenty of time to negotiate indeed since hes signed until the end of the next season Can you blame them If Ricciardo continues to slump around in the lower midfield while Lando challenges for podiums I would not be at all surprised if McLaren buy out his contract and go with a new driver for 2023 When its all said and done I think Ricciardo while be viewed as a capable driver that made some bad career decisions and survived off his Red Bull reputation for a bit too long i have been around here for a few years and I Have never seen such hate for Danny its like he killed everyone is dogs Really not sure where its coming from to be honest Daniel is only 32hes got a lot left to give in Formula One I Am just amazed how far his performances have dipped I guess hes really sensitive to the car if its not working to his liking the results will be averagebelow average What he had at Red Bull and to a degree at Renault is not translating over at McLaren I do not know what people are talking about to be honest He was absolutely off the pace on Bahrain but obviously recovering from covid and lack of track action In Saudi he qualified next to Norris and with only a tenth between them and his race pace was great before his retirement In Australia he qualified a few places down on Lando but finished the race only half a second behind him In Imola again only a few places down in qualifying on Lando finished directly behind I Am in the sprint then his race was fucked in turn 1 Partially his fault but Bottas hit him anyway which damaged his car and ruined any fightback but he kept going the rest of the race with a damaged car getting good data for the team Hes a little short of Norris ATM same as Carlos is a little short of Leclerc Perez a little short of Max and Hamilton a little short of Russell But its not like last year where he clearly could not get a handle on the car Its logical for McLaren to do that Sadly Daniel since 2021 has big decline of form losing to Lando especially in qualies adaptation problems in 21 thanks to that McLaren was P4 not P3 and only had 23 flashes For person who was in TOP 5 2020 drivers it is unacceptable I do not see Ricciardo staying after 2023 if he keeps struggling that much compared to Norris but in F1 a lot can change in that timeframe I sure hope he will improve his race pace Oh Ricciardo I really hope you can prove the doubters wrong buddy Yeah I listened to the podcast and this is clickbait If Danny performs well this year and he has been on par with Lando every race except the shunt at Imola where he was right with Lando he will get another deal But of course McLaren wants to see what their young drivers can do Every team feels that way Should hold on then grab a senior Porsche seat to help them get a grip early Feels like a good fit with his late braking and all Unless something picks up with Daniel I can see them getting OWard or another one of the indy guys in Good hes too much of a wildcard atm Needs to pull off a miracle in these next few races before we can even begin thinking of a future for Ricc at McLaren Huge fan love to see him in his prime again I feel like ricciardo is absolutely no certainty to retain his seat atm His performance would need to lift substantially to justify an extension I would have thought I think Danny was just really suited to Red Bull cars He was known for breaking at the very last second and for his ballsy overtakes I get the feeling that the McLaren is just a different type of car and he is not suited to driving it I bet if you could put him back in a RBR car he would be placing a lot better but the fact that he has a huge salary and is getting beat by Lando are already two strikes Zak mentions looking to the future we all know that means putting an American driver in the second seat Unfortunately you do not look to the future with a guy his age in F1 anymore It is a young man’s game now I think he would just retire He has said many times that if he cannot win a WDC then what is the point He has more than enough money he will just land in LA and have a bunch of sex I do not really see him doing anything else in F1 frankly the guy is as dumb as a bag of hammers But he looks good so he will be just fine I still do not get the Renault move he made if not for the crazy money than what else would be the reason to go to a team whose engine just ruined your last shot at a WDC He is completely lost in that McLaren for sure But who could do better I do not think there is neither a better driver available nor an amazing rookie waiting for that seat Maybe they could reach an agreement with Alpine and sign Piastri and maybe even use Renault motors that could be benefitial for both as the Mercedes PU is quite weak and Alpine could use the data analysis of two more cars but I do not know Smart from them Id go for someone else surely WELP Pato O’Ward should get his seat Two Mexicans in F1 would be so amazingly cool I love Danny Ric as much as the next one but his stay at McLaren has been underwhelming Racking up this kind of salary to perform at a mediocre level most of the time below his teammate does not look great Maybe McLaren value his PRpower and technical insights more than we understand but performance wise its hard to justify keeping him for the salary he has deleted He does not belong in f1 anymore I would love to see him replaced by Piastri If you win F3 F2 back to back you are good and deserve a shot RIC had his shot Now that I Am used to the 18 inch rims these things look tiny lol I believe that is actually the Renault 2020 car the RS20 OT I really liked Slovenia when I went there Where did you see this As a Slovenian I feel its my duty to go see it in person where in slovenia excatly is this Holy bargeboards The nose has ALOs 14 but towards the back of the car you see Ocons 31 Hmmmmm That Is actually tadej pogacar is it just more or does that look very short That actually looks like a real car but it is 2020 not 2021 I think based on the barge boards and the vents right behind the halo which I do not think they had in 2021 FWIW its not last years car or any other years Its a show car a fake car with a mix of parts in many cases they are things that were never even for another car and in some extreme cases red bull are known for this the car is a plastic she will I am so happy we got rid of barge boards Fucking hideous They look so clunky and boxy now especially with all that greebling Saward only wrote that de Vries might be a good candidate for a Latifi swap He did not write that they were in any contact sees Latifi’s seat “Huh I wonder who that is for” Whether he ever gets a seat in F1 or not I hope Sky hires the guy for more broadcasts He has the insight of a Nico in his analysis and a somewhat similar impressive grasp of the English language but seems to connect way better with the grid when doing interviews De Vries surprised by Williams rumours Wonder where they got that from Kimberley Hoefnagel Thursday 28 April 2022 1456 Last update 1505 GPFans spoke exclusively with the people involved for this article Nyck de Vries has not yet had any contact with the Williams team about a possible switch to Formula 1 he told GPFans The driver from Sneek is not aware of the rumours and emphasises that he will continue to focus on his Formula E campaign Earlier this week there were rumours in the British media that the Williams team would be interested in bringing Nyck de Vries in The British team would like to continue without Nicholas Latifi in 2023 and is therefore looking for his replacement According to Sky Sports the team has its sights set on Alpine reserve driver Oscar Piastri However Joe Saward a renowned Formula One journalist said that Williams doubts that this is the right move The team would rather work on its own future by putting someone in that seat who is not linked to another team De Vries was put forward as the best candidate De Vries responds to rumours De Vries himself however has no idea where this rumour came from These rumours are new to me the 27yearold told GPFans in an exclusive interview I have no idea where you read them the rumours ed or where you came across them But then I Am very curious where they got that from the Mercedes driver stressed Because honestly I have no idea Asked if De Vries would consider a move to Williams he replied Of course Formula 1 is a dream That is a dream for every young driver but otherwise I think it is still quite early in the season We are only at the sixth race in our championship So yes let us first make sure we get a few points here again said the Dutchman Translated with wwwDeepLcomTranslator free version De Vries is one of those guys who went under radar because guys like Mick get F1 seat thanks to their name and guys like Mazepin got their seat by just money Mazepin won same amount races as Mick in F2 season but he had the 5th best team Not prema Tsunoda won 3 awards in F2 that season for a reason Coming to Singapore for the first time this year Very excited What are the major tourist attractions that would be good to do during the daylate afternoon before the F1 sessions Is there a lot of food options that will be open late at night after the F1 sessions What is the best transport from i do not know the area but from Geylang Road near ‘Eminent Frog Porridge’ to the track Is it easiest to get from the airport to the city via rail And is google maps reliable for public transport Sorry for all the questions haha Nice to see a fellow sinkie F1 fan here My favourite place to go in SG is Boon Tong Kee they have many locations but I cannot resist their Steamed Chicken and Rice Crispy bean curd Also frog leg porridge at 4 am tastes good too Finallysingapore fans How nice of you to do this thank you I am a Singaporean myself haha and looking to attend this year GP after following f1 religiously since 2019 Understand that the early bird tickets were sold out so looking to get one closer to the date Having said that which areazoneticket will give me the most value and how many days would you suggest I should attend Any other tips are appreciated where can I buy one of those half cooked egg makers where you just pour boiling water it nice work fellow sg lad Is there any seb singapore merch being sold near the track I think I saw a few images of them sold in local shops as he is the lion of Singapore I have been to Singapore many many times and am looking forward to the GP this year as far as the GP goes what is the premier location to view the race from the track and what is the best post race venue Any recommendations for areas to stay at I will be at the Bay Grandstand and a bit lost at the moment on where to stay lodgings wise I mean I got a ticket to the pit grandstand Taking an extended vacation from work this year as I am working far too much and finishing it with the race Splurging on accommodations and the tickets but I love street food Fancy parties are not my thing Any highlights for hawker centres near the track area I love walking through cities best way to get a feel for the place so if it is a few kilometres away that is all good Additionally are the concerts an all day or night thing Cannot wait to experience this Thanks so much for doing this Do you know in general where drivers come in to the track so we have the opportunity for a picture or autograph Right now my wife and I have tickets for Turn 1 which gets us access to all four Zones I believe We are also staying for a week after the race Anything you recommend we go do on weekdays where there are less crowds possibly Thanks Booked my flight just a few days ago coming from the US Houston Texas and have a few general questions In markets and food centres are transactions mostly cashless or do you always need to carry a good amount of cash What is the scene like around the circuit both before and after the events each evening Packed bars and convenience shops difficult to get around etc Does it take long to get inout of the track area like how much time should you budget for ticket scanning finding seats food and drink lines etc I Have been told I must try Chili Crab as such any recommendations for Chili Crab locales We were hoping to go to the GP as we are vacationing in Bali at that time but a 3 hour flight is just a bit too far for a one day trip We will be sure to plan it better next year have fun you all I depart in the morning to go to Miami for my first Grand Prix Have tickets in the turn 1 grandstands Does anyone have any advice Really excited for the GP most of the track looks like it should be fun from a racing standpoint and from a viewers standpoint I still hate the overly tacky couple of bits but depending on how the race is directed I hope I will not have to see the stupid marina and beach more than once I do not understand the rampant hate for this GP before its even happened once So many F1 fans are just obnoxiously stuck in the past All this hype around Miami feels like F1 is trying to replace Monaco Does anyone know if RedBull brought further upgrades to Miami Or are they running their Imola update package This feels like the ultimate apples to oranges comparison where there is no correct answer but here goes What is the best part of any track to be a viewer at In other words if you could have a front row seat to any place on the F1 calendar where are you sitting Is it where the track is Is it how good the racing is at that specific part Is it how good a look you get at the action US people going to Montreal what is your strategy for getting tested before returning to the US Our hotel is kind of boutiqueey so its not offering inhotel testing They sent me to this service Biron that is expensive but does testing I Am wondering if there is anything else I Am missing Thanks I am watching the Classic USA 1982 F1 race in Las Vegas on Sky F1 what a terrible looking track I did not realise it genuinely was in the car park of Caesar’s Palace looks like it was throw together in a few days I am genuinely beyond excited for the Miami GP This is hyped up a lot by the videos and F1’s investment Looks very exciting Has any Grand Prix been hyped as much as Miami this year Singapore 2008 might be that one as it was the first ever night race in F1 but I do not think any other race matched the hype Does anyone know of any F1 related things to see outside of the circuit itself I know that there is a Red Bull show car in front of one of the hotels and there is a Williams pop up somewhere but other than that I am not sure of anything happening around the city Austin was great for a few years when it came to F1 stuff to see around town I Am in the UK where the F1 TV app does not work for live streaming without a vpn but does anyone know if you can watch recent races the day after or week after I know it offers historic races but I just want to know how recent of a race you can watch What happened to that Show and tell thing they were introducing this year I assume I have just completely missed it but I thought it would be a bigger deal when I first heard about it Iv only just got back into F1 but I feel SkyF1 are very pushy in terms of getting in the drivers faces etc and they had an interview with Christian on the pit wall mid race How do you add the F1teams to your reddit name How are race distances determined As far as I know they have to be at least 300km I Have come to learn that the upcoming Miami GP will be around 308km So why is it this and why not one lap less or one lap more Thanks Question for some of you Grand Prix veterans the Miami Grand Prix will be the first for my friend and I We have seats at turn 18 and I could not be more excited to actually watch in person Just wondering what is the best way to watch Have the F1TV international broadcast playing in headphones for commentary Is there much of a delay Or will the screensproduction there be good enough to follow what is happening Any other tips and tricks are super appreciated Are ticket prices normally this high for an F1 race I was so excited when they announced the GP in Miami and was planning on going It would be my first GP but prices are soo high I Am discouraged to purchase a ticket at the current prices I Am looking every 30 min for ticket price changes Does anyone know a good place to purchase tickets Or even have an extra one Honestly any advice is appreciated thanks OverUnder on how many times we see Brady and Jordan on race day I am genuinely excited not just because it is in the states but I like seeing new tracks With that said was there ever any talk about holding it at night I mean I understand the issue with timing and having a race at 010300 in Europe but racing under the lights at this track would be amazing Anyone know of watch parties in NYC Not usually my thing but Miami seems like a good one to watch with a crew I want to learn more about the science behind the cars Does anyone have good resources I am very knowledgeable about physics so I will take any references Idc if its meant for a child or a PhD I have an extra room at the Eden Roc for Miami The hotels are now going for 1200 USD a night I paid 300 and would be willing to transfer to someone for the 300 a night rate… best place to offer this up I am currently awaiting my requests to join some Facebook groups for Miami How was ferrari allowed to test a new floor during the pirelli tyre tests 40 of rain on Sunday in Miami 👀 Why Are you guys so hard to please Anyone else surprised that nascar is having their Darlington race at the same time as the Miami GP I do not personally like nascar myself but I Am wondering which series decided on that timeslot first and if the other decided to compete directly by design or if its just an unfortunate coincidence Wondering what the fans of both series think of this I do love F1 for making one of the few races on the calendar that I could have a drink during since its not on at 8am happen on mothers day so I get to miss it on the road I do not watch much Sports Center and I am not in Florida but disappointed in the lack of hype for this race in the general media Seems like there was a lot of talk after Texas last year Not sure what I am expecting but it seems to be very quiet Does anyone know anything about the relationship in the garage at Alfa I feel like I have heard relatively little about the team despite decent performances from Bottas and Zhou just saw they are 4th in Constructors I have heard rumours about a RicciardoGasly swap does this rumour have any merit Or is it just something to gain attention It is so annoying how hard they are pushing the GP Sending George to a heat game LeClerc checo and max to a marlins game Pierre meeting Jordan and Lewis with Tom Brady No Fernando at the Miami opening Not sure why F1 is going with the So Bad Its Good approach for this race any idea Has there ever been an F race where they just threw up a race track and no one really knew what was going to happen on it like this From my understanding Miami has a lot of long straights and Red Bull has been the fastest on the straights Therefore Max is the favorite this weekend Is this thinking correct Anyone order Miami merch from Mclaren Just curious if anyone has had their order ship yet I ordered on launch day and only got an order email nothing about shipping yet Was hoping to get it before the race Sunday What Is the best site for buying GP tickets second hand Ill be in Houston during the USGP on Oct 23 I found some tickets on seatgeek is that any good Is miami open to general trackrace activities beyond f1 like Cota Or is this strictly an f1 venue When do you think the seasons first race without a safety car will be I feel like the DRS will be overpowered here the one in the finish straigh line looks fine but the other 2 seems to long Can someone explain the water meme that is been going around before the Miami gp Anyone going to Baku Recommendation on hotels hey guys i see you pop up on my frontpage from tiem to time so i think of you guys once in awhile well today a live streamer his name is Jake was invited by the mclaren racing team so hes in the cars and in the pits Any Charlotte NC fans in here so what will be the fast lap time in practice will there be any safety cars in the race i say yes I need to get this off my chest Other than COTA the f1 season should not recur in the USA Not Las Vegas or Miami It feels like an money making machine now why would they give the USA out of all countries three races It is beginning to feel like a joke at this point I am actually looking forward to hearing some peoples opinion But this is driving me crazy the tracks they create now seem so familiar it is so annoying at least take DRS out now if the cars can race closer And for the love of god design a track that is not walled off Make it safer and more accessible to other sports Adopt new tracks just do not create these long straights where that is the only way to overtake It is getting annoying at this point 22 races is too much Drivers know they can afford to DNF out of 12 races and still win the championship Make it less make every rave worth more Okay I am done Hes a shit person a bad driver and his countrys government is fucking up but Nikitas 2022 helmet was nice as hell Is there any elevation change around the Miami track or is it all flat I Am not super privy on how the point system has worked over the years but has a championship or maybe even a position in the standings been decided by a fastest lap If not is it possible with current system Ok so we know that track time is limited in f1 cars The only times they can practice is during fp1 etc But what is dripping them from getting in an f2 car and taking it out to get a feel for the track Does anyone know anything about the relationship in the garage at Alfa I feel like I have heard relatively little about the team despite decent performances from Bottas and Zhou just saw they are 4th in Constructors English version For the first time a Formula 1 race weekend will take place in Miami The route in the Sunshine State is therefore completely unknown the drivers could only test it using the simulator The fans are all the more excited about the performance of the individual camps and which updates can be expected After the debacle in Imola special focus is on Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton for whom the new terrain in Florida could also be an opportunity Opponent Red Bull on the other hand is on top after the double victory in the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari World champion Max Verstappen won ahead of teammate Sergio Perez and at the same time caused disillusionment at the Scuderia which could not live up to its expectations at the Ferrari home game World championship leader Charles Leclerc finished sixth Carlos Sainz retired Nevertheless the outcome of the coming race weekend not least because of the unfamiliar track is completely open Said street circuit the Miami International Autodrome which runs around the Hard Rock Stadium of the Miami Dolphins has many challenging corners and a 128 km long straight ready in which top speeds of up to 320 kmh can be reached Three DRS zones also provide a spectacle The pay TV station broadcasts the race I Am just glad Mazepin is not racing this track Feel bad for Latifi already though'"

       "['translated by deepl the fia is going to enforce more strictly the rule that drivers are not allowed to wear jewelry and wear their own nonfireproof clothing indeed it will become part of the technical inspection of the car it was before the australian grand prix that the driver notes prepared by the race director highlighted some already existing rules drivers were not allowed to wear jewelry nor were they allowed to wear their own clothing that was not homologated by the fia lewis hamilton among others took umbrage and indicated that he would in fact be wearing more while mercedes team principal toto wolff was surprised by the new race directors focus points is this the battle they want to take on hamilton now well if this is the worst were not complaining teams now actually risk a penalty that mention of rules that have been in place for a long time had to be read as a warning at the time as it now appears now in fact the fia is going a step further before the start of each weekend the teams have to sign a document declaring that the car complies with the technical regulations now however two additional passages have been included on that form the teams have to declare that the drivers do not wear any jewelry and therefore do not wear their own clothing racingnews365 has seen the document with these new passages these two aspects are now part of the technical inspection of the cars which means that if they are not met the teams registration must be considered illegal normally this will result in an exclusion from the race but in practice it is possible that a fine or a grid penalty will be imposed toto wolff already reacted to the shifting of the rules in the presence of racingnews365 and has now expressed a more nuanced opinion we have to remember why the fia is doing this namely to prevent injuries caused by jewelry nobody is waiting for a freak accident in which that plays a part so the fia has to draw a line somewhere is this a key issue i do not think so but i understand where its coming from \"so what is the dress code\" \"business racing\" inspired by the colour of flag that he will see more of this season the checkered sleeves are a homage to the type of flag he used to see ahead of others in the past seasons aaaaaaaaaaand as always he looks like a pretentious knob this is half the reason i do not like the guy hes always got to try and make a statement the sleeve reminded me of hp sponsored williams is \"his blue outfit\" a thing bruh how is this man not sweating buckets hamilton switching to corvette racing in imsa confirmed zhous shorts are stylish instagram story of both of them i think max is wearing his gf\\'s glasses 6 drivers 3 cars the red bull academy has too many drivers not enough seats jesus look at the williams\\' top speed if only they could figure the rest out williams the best or nothing do not forget to peg bottas as your monaco winner in fantasy note these are broad categories thus not every corner type is accounted for mclaren for example excel in mediumhigh speed corners and mediumlow however this is not included to make it more simple very surprising that mercedes showed up so well in medium and high speed corners as well as on the straights it would seem that porpoising would prove the most disruptive there these look correct haas does its best on medium speed corner what track is best for that direct link to video here hq that t1 camera crane must be higher than any of the guests in miami this weekend volume up the only thing i am not looking forward to this weekend is baking in the sun wonder what the track surface will be like original resolution images from tweet image 1 image 2 image 3 is that a miamispecific livery eh that livery is way too busy for me so much going on its almost like camouflage slightly unrelated but the bh jordan had a pretty good color scheme did not it that paint looks heavy lol that paint looks heavy lol i love the air intake it is perfect looks a battery maybe a bit out of place but it is great i love the duracell design until the brakes explode hope they fixed that issue original res photo i suspect they need to reduce drag as the car is designed to gain most of its downforce trough the floor less drag could also result in less porpoising as we see drs also results in less porpoising the downside is that they lose downforce in general so if they cannot fully utilize their floor they car is just flawed beyond repair the best or nothing are all of the merc changes marginal incremental this far in 2022 yup that is it that is the key let us fucking go i guess this is a good time for ben to see how things are being run over in america first meeting roger penske to discuss indycar and now meeting jim for nascar saturday race 1 230p et espnewsespn3 sunday race 2 1035a et espn2 more info about all this here nice this is big news for them how long till we get a female f1 driver motogp satellite teams do not buy chassis moto2moto3 teams do howevever they buy entire bikes with motors gearbox and all from factories it is close enough to a spec series to call it one and being a spec series is not negative the actual racing in indy is fantastic as a massive indycar fan it is essentially a spec series indycar is a spec series though k sir this is a wendys much like fe it is a mostly spec series i suppose this post was meant to be posted in rindycar indycar is between being a \\'spec series\\' and an \\'open development\\' series being in the middle bewteen both approaches allows them to attract new teams as there is development on the table while keeping the costs reasonable its a similar approach to what formula e has been chasing lately the \\'spec series\\' part of the equation allows indycar to have close racing despite being in a meyer shank car or in a dayle coyne car you still have the chance to fighg for pole positions and race wins that is something which does not happen on series with \\'open development\\' having free development on shocks and dampers does not make indycar a series focused on \\'open development\\' it is a very important part of the car but it is not the whole car letting indycar teams fully develop the chassis and have special partnerships with engine manufacturers would only skyrocket the operational costs of indycar for all intents and purposes indycar is still considered as a \\'spec series\\' because of the same chassis gearbox body which is ultimately what the spectator and average fan will look for the racing is still pretty much what you would find on a \\'spec series\\' like formula e or formula 2 indycar is in the middle of the road and that way of operating has been beneficial to them i have been getting into the ferrari challenge series it is a super spec series the cars are 100 identical and yet there are still like 10 static adjustments you can make and 6 realtime adjustments spec means that the cars are mostly identical as opposed to open or box designs indy falls closest to the spec category cannot imagine that being too comfortable in the miami heat when you have to meet with the queen at 2 but going skiing at 3 straight outta mortal kombat mans never hot is not it like blistering hot in miami right now this is one of the first lewis fits that i am genuinely confused by blueis hamilton i love this one usually cannot stand them awesome fact he is not sweating might be more impressive than his driving records when airline loses your luggage its officially rawe ceek what anime is this from i know i do not understand fashion but man commonwind breaker under dress cloths looks like a jester drowning in drip get that guy an oxygen tank runexpectedsimontemplar looks like he would fight jackie chans or donnie yens character halfway through their respective movie could not attend the meet gala so he brought the met to miami why is he wearing the runescape agility icon around his neck mortal kombat vibe he looks like a bond villain drip king at it again man could not go to the met gala so he makes his own show i love lewis style but this really seems like it should have been a one or the other type deal the blue suit is sick the jacket is sick they look bizarre layered that is sir lewis to you tracksuit is lv sunglasses are offwhite someone please id the vest and pants i wish i had as much confidence and money i mean no hate or disrespect but can people explain to me why this is considered to be fashionable or is it just a you get it or do not kind of thing predicting his race being blue flagged high fashion is dumb change my mind my man\\'s got swag prince is turning over in his grave this one is a miss too bad the last few ones were drip too cocky for a second driver of a midfield team these guys in general must be pretty acclimated to higher heat humidity i am sweating just looking at him does anyone know if hes still featuring black designers met gala was earlier this week lewis lol omg the weekend has begun do you think he has another layer on under the jacket to really seal in his drip a lot of people fail to realize hot hot the drivers get in the cars wearing this is nothing i swear hes intentially taking the piss now that is some actual king shit alright this ones actually pretty sick that is gifting him about 20lbs that is the same cloth as blue flags my boy like to train agility i usually am amused at his outfits but this one is just really bad ahahahah mans won the fit battle this week this shits just goofy do we have a sub just for lewis drips i am all in for it hahaha not climatefriendly manufacturing new clothes every day the man should focus on his car as much as he does his clothes perhaps then he could match russell looks like a dork the court jester has arrived is it a minute behind the frontrunners really dig it bar the strap how much is it a million wonder if it bounces up and down on your wrist if you move your arm i love the colors but watch prices are a bit too much for me if they did the watch face in the petronas blue it would have been like the tiffany nautilus quality of the images are pretty poor but i am very glad to see the introduction of the duracell colours blue and copper is a hot combo how long until the williams mechanics strip that paint off to save weight nice idea original res photos photo photo 2 that is a very cool paint job it immediately invokes batteries well done to the designer man the picture in the replies is great looks fantastic those cheap bastards using a combination of left and right corners to design their track glad they did not replicate the tyreshredder roundabout where is the top view hanoi was an absolutely brutal track in f1 2020 could not stand it miami thankfully looks to have better flow wait so hanoi is not real i have been hating a fake track for years so nice catch when i watched the miami f1 2022 gameplay i was genuinely confused for a moment thinking it was was vietnam lol valtteri\\'s social media shenanigans do not get enough appreciation but dudes more active than almost any other driver on the grid when it comes to random wittyenjoyable content it is incredible you can see the instagram video of this here valtteri is clearly having fun xd he really is living his best life these days is not he good for him in all fairness to the pose he is about the size of one of their cheerleaders so is there a sports team in and around the miami area that an f1 driver has not been to see in the past 4 days vb always looks like one of the biggest drivers but those dudes make him look tiny no tua in sight espn later today f1 driver also hates tua brazzers bottas a fin with the fins laces out this has way too much nsfw meme potential and you know exactly what i am talking about man being on mercedes really suppressed valterri\\'s public character alfa seems fun leaving that porpoising tractor has been the best decision ever for bottas he looks joyful laces out laces out need a picture of valtteri with christian wilkins leaving that porpoising tractor has been the best decision ever for bottas he looks joyful he really loves that alpha shirt lol these f1 guys are so gosh darn cuddly looks like the intro of a porn movie xd just some guys being dudes lol f1 drivers are tiny well at least its not weird no no no i love how it is about racing fun so tired of people on social media pushing their personal agendas hamburg may 5 reuters an agreement for volkswagens vowgpde premium brand audi to join formula one by investing in british luxury sports carmaker mclaren is becoming increasingly unlikely a person familiar with the project told reuters on thursday the price expectations are too far apart the person said adding that while the project had not yet failed its prospects are now close to zero meanwhile talks with swissbased sauber which runs the ferraripowered alfa romeo team and williams are continuing the person said both audi and volkswagen declined to comment a tale as old as time always has been i see that mclaren is doing everything to be customer and have almost 0 chance for title fight is this a sabotage or something i really hope they buy williams they could use a helping hand more detail on new wing changes from scarbs more analysis on new fw by scarbs these just some regular downforce adaptations to a track rather then a true differentiator of airflow or something radical are these the radical changes mercedes is going to bring to become p1 again they cannot change the nose without a new crash test right so the 3 kg is all in the wingswingtips i honestly do not see 3 kg there but whatev is this the only update they brought you can polish a turd but at the end of the day it is still a piece of shit old looks better futurrrrreee face lift mario party mini game its florida there is always a chance for rain its what happens when you build your state on a swamp that pretty normal for this time of year this is actually good bit hot weather for miami this is just showing there is the chance for a quick 30min1hr pop us shower very heavy rain chance but it is usually quick its a peninsula it rains frequently i lived there for a few years and its super common for a single cloud to roll through and drop an inch or two of rain in the span of 30 minutes then go back to sunny weather apps does not tell us a lot they are all based of a computer model with no human input just watch the tv meteorologist or check nws miami on the morning of race source i am a meteorologist when i lived in god\\'s waiting room it seemed to rain everyday in the morning and afternoon for a 20 minute shower 39 chance of getting 7 one hundredths of an inch rain in the forecast we might get some real water in the marina surprised nobody has made a joke about the fake marina yet yesmaybemeh 40 chance of rain with a high of 90f lmao event goers are about to know what it feels like to lose 10lb in an afternoon florida weather it could rain real hard for a couple of minutes or it could do that nearby and completely miss you it is pretty random the lights make it look cool i like this one it is different than the traditional blue and pink theme it is clean big weekend for you yuki and need to lift rooting for another great race as a general rule see full rules a standalone discussion post

informed its episode 178 missed apex gets my vote also i would just skip to season 4 of d2s and watch it its interesting to see where the teams finished and where they are at currently f1 nation official f1 race preview and reviews especially the race reviews got a lot better this year with direct interviews from the paddock with drivers and other team personnel missed apex and f1 beyond the grid any time joe saward is on missed apex is what you should listen to i like scuderia f1 podcast missed apex is my favorite the panel is great and occasionally hilarious shiftf1 podcast it is a longterm us podcast but very accessible they have a preseason primer episode to get you up to speed i quite enjoy missed apex they can be biased towards lewis especially end of 2021 at times but i enjoy the structure of their podcast and they are usually the first to get a show out after the race i also like the ringer f1 show wtf1 just watch donut medias video on youtube on f1 its really good and wtf1 has good information for beginners too glad to have you in this community and i hope you start loving the sport we all fell in love with here 3 you definitely need to binge watch dts s4 from last season beforeas you fly down there also like other have said episode 178 from shiftf1 is all you will need to listen to id recommend back of the grid if you are a brit not a podcast but chain bear on youtube and b sport also on youtube have some great explanation vids on aerodynamics track regulations tyres porpoising that type of stuff ask in daily thread contrast and compair zak to some of the other ceos and damn is he an amazing personality in the sport god i wish that were me also did not f1 ban plane flybys this season i was super bummed when they announced it there are pilots and then there are the blue angels who are absolutely insane wonder if daniel or lando would have wanted to go but zak was like \"drivers cannot go too risky oh by the way i am available\" thhe blue angels is the only thing i have seen in person that rivals f1indycar at speed truly deathdefying amazingly blue angels shows and top gun movies are net positives for the us department of defense that is actually your tax dollars working for you the recruitment benefit outweighs the expense also the blue angels are the most bad ass flying formation in the world but there is a reason the navy will not allow the airforces f22 to fly at naval airshows it is the most stunning and maneuverable airplane that will ever be built by humankind zak definitely seems to be living his best life these days also seems like hes been dropping weight lately no i feel the need man is living life would be really cool to be a multi millionaire deleted original res photo there are many posts showing this particular car its the renault rs20 from the 2020 season not the a521 its got both drivers numbers on too no comment after 2 hours how are you planning on organising this gathering lol flea market display with gucci prices 450 for a tshirt haas offering their caps for 30 is the only reasonable thing i remember at the hungary gp when i was 10 i begged my parents to get me a lewis hamilton mclaren cap they told me its too expensive but they got me one it was 20 buying the haas cap cannot afford to be a better fan than that is that 130 for the purple mercedes hat or is there something below it that cannot be right til my budget is \"haas\" even if i had it i would not spend that kind of money on a that mclaren racing f1 new era 940 2022 special edition fade miami hat is 42 on amazon fyi lol slap that tiny f1 logo 110 gtfo i am good lol haas first year cap for 40 of new big team caps yes please that is a big premium on the merch gene gaining some fans statistically speaking how often is a sucker born wow really judging my past self for scoffing at 20 cocktail drinks at cota in 20162019 range that even included the nice glass it came in this weekend is going to be all sorts of level of stupid and throwing huge amounts of money away it will drive people crazy there is always someone stupid enough to buy those prices make me think this is a tent outside of the track somewhere trying to scalp people i do not think these are actual f1 shop prices there is a sucker born every minute 30 bucks haas cap let us gooooo f1flation 80 for a year old cap seems about right eff that 450 for a 6 button tshirt hell no i have dropped some serious coin at texas gp before but i went home with a lot of stuff this is bs looks like the same prices as austin last year i got my cheapass 40 austin grand prix hat and loved ituntil my dog ate it if i had spent 130 i might have wished the hat ate the dog since he would be cheaper to replace there is a huge markup on this stuff you can buy the same shit on their websites for much less probably the venue taking their cut here is this possibly a stand that is outside the track or is this an official stand pretty similar to cota last year looking like i would be rooting for haas haas for the people this is usd jesus that is ridiculous prices are probably going to be outrageous at the montreal grand prix you should look into americas cup merchandise this garbage in miami is targeted at millionaires pfft i pity americas cup merch is targeted at megamillionaires for a half a second i almost considered getting a 230 prada americas cup tshirt after a friendgirl said yeah but i am pretty sure that is the least expensive prada product ever offered for sale you might want to buy a few edit i am broker than shit i am just really into sailing everyone that reads this post should look into the ac if you did not know 95 of ac fans are f1 fans but only like 1 of f1 fans are ac fans ac and f1 are very similar they are all about rules design engineering and fluid dynamics but the ac has both aerodynamics and hydrodynamics if you like f1 you will like the americas cup its priced similarly to other prestige events like the masters americas cup etc peter millar is just a scam though nothing could make me buy their sportswear all of this shit is way cheaper online 80 for a hat 110 for a shirt ok i scared to even convert dollars to my currency it is all putin\\'s fault first time at a gp they are always insanely expensive went to austin in 2018 and 2019 and the hats were 60 shirts and jackets were 80120 that was 34 years ago add inflation and popularity and you have todays prices peter millar is not cheap but a 14 zip pullover is not 450 it is 150 tops are these prices standard for buying at the event location i was planning to buy merch at the canadian gp but it looks like i can only afford haas polo better come with a hooker f1 is for the rich those prices are a joke lol this is what happens when americans buy the sport smh fans are counted as revenue streams only f1 and miami two things that are not cheap honestly these prices are pretty close to normal nfl merch in miami at a game if you worry about prices miami is not for you i just do not understand the appeal it all looks like tat to me my wallet is pleased what the actual fuck and prices will only go up through the weekend bro heading down there now clearly will not be buying any merch and am going to eat a large breakfast and lunch just buy them on aliexpress few bucks ridiculous basic shirts with a logo on it not even cool designs or whatever wtf that cannot be real bwoah merc white cap is free right right yet another reason to support haas and gunthers go fund me for a new boat teams overcoming budget cap with overpriced merch prices s that is just sad driving people away from representing their brand when i was in imola this year the ferrari baseball caps were 60 and mercedes 40 and i thought that was outrageous lol does anyone buy these at these prices beer goggle pricing surely they would make more money in the long run by lowering the price this is nonsense modern day pricing is usually based on demandsupply rather than a fixed margin over cost that is why so many mega companies grow in value so much because they keep reducing their costs keep increasing their margins and keep increasing their prices while a cap might be 30 on the website they know they if you do not have it and you want to flaunt your support for a team you are going to get it even at a premium hence the inflated costs for things that are relatively less expensive online that is insane i know merch prices do not reflect all prices but man i feel at this rate i will never be able to afford to go a f1 race in the us between travel and price of tickets for more than 1 person it just is not possible unless i am looking in the wrong place i remeber going to us gp cota and hats being like 45 dollars and that was 2016 inflation has not gone up that much 110 dollars for a tshirt kind of pricey f1 how much is the program like 90 dollars not abnormal for races in north america i went to montreal in 2010 and prices were insane even then 70 for a hat 110 for a shirt and 200 for a jacket lmao what fanatics has this all where is that famous budget cap that white polo is legitimately more than a third of my monthly rent definitely would cop that haas hat i am so embarrassed for this whole event so far i see supply and demand is in full effect regarding the haas hat always knew supporting haas would pay me back somehow haha wait until this guy finds out how much pimento cheese sandwiches are at the masters lol miami gp is f1 attempting a total cash grab from the american elite and i get it f1 cars are expensive bummer middleclass fans are getting gouged for souvenirs cheaper than in brazil gp at least well that is gross i love f1 but i feel like attending a race in person or buying the merch is targeted for the uber wealthy damn ill take that haas hat for 30 are those online anywhere i remember liberty media saying they wanted to treat each race like the way the nfl does with the super bowl these prices would back that claim christ they cannot be serious250 for a polo i know inflation is bad but dam not that bad why did they do my haas like that the crack mentality continues right down the food chain haas being real ones i would take a haas hat what the fuck i would buy the haas hat do they not sell pirelli caps at the race what does the 450 shirt do i mean i have two kidneys so i am kind of glad everything is expensive now i do not have to worry about spending any money while at the event i guess if you can afford 2k ticket you can spend 450 on a fking polo god damn the team hats seem to be about the same prices they were at cota in october i have never seen generic f1 merch so overpriced though everyday indycar becomes more and more appealing to me i mean apart from the polos have you been to a concert recently inflation i own zero merch because of their bs prices bro those haas prices be bangin haas with the closest to a reasonable hat price sorry but 450 for that whoa i remember going to silverstone 2019 and it costing 80 for any teams tshirt absolute joke i ended up getting a senna hoodie for 30 instead because if it do not let them rip you off jesus christ meanwhile it looks like a flea market in a third world country i always found it interesting that the seminole indian tribe now completely owns hard rock international this makes miami rb\\'s fifth home race on the calendar looks like the hump at the chicane took max off guard that long straight is just a showcase of the cars straightline speed considering there is no way to set yourself coming out of that chicane professor max his ease at the wheel almost makes you think he does this kind of thing for a living i enjoyed the commentary on it as well hope those two kerbs are not so big in real life or his underbody might be in for a world of pain looks cool very long straight i assume he is in assetto corsa running laps i cannot really tell what sim he is in but i know ac has a mod with the track interesting in the other sim laps videos that rb posts i mentioned how he has a little twerk of his leg whenever he goes full throttle i actually found a video from a mexican pr thing with albon where you could see both drivers legs max did it as well alex did not but in this video no twerk or maybe its the camera angle right between his legs is that the actual red bull sim that chicane is like a cannon comparison between the new rear wing and the old one via duchessa dear lord even more colors popping on that merc car i think it is the same front wing but with a different adjustment they should replace the petronas accent colors with these new color patterns weird livery seeing magnussen do well is such a great story so incredibly happy for him hopefully mick can bring his performance at least on par with k mags it certainly does schumacher is in a car that can score points and hes failed to deliver so far david coulthard mick schumachers future depends on magnussen duel if mick schumacher wants a future in formula 1 he must not look old against kevin magnussen the dane is a surprise for david coulthard author norman fischer coauthor erwin jaeggi 05052022 1725 david coulthard mick schumachers future depends on magnussen duel mick schumachers future in formula one depends heavily on how he fares against his haas teammate kevin magnussen says former driver david coulthard schumacher was seen as a rising star after his convincing performances against nikita masepin in his first year but has stagnated somewhat this season for so far schumacher has been pretty much disenchanted by magnussen the dane made his formula 1 comeback at short notice after a year out and has scored points in three out of four races so far magnussen has already scored 15 points while schumacher along with nicholas latifi is one of only two regular drivers without points micks future depends in many ways on the comparison with kevin coulthard told the dutch edition of motorsportcom at an iwc schaffhausen charity event at miami beach golf club when you get into formula one you are given a rookie year but then you have to deliver the scot said people do not wait for you to be quick you have to be mick beats magnussen only with hard work so far the germans career has actually gone to plan schumacher was champion in formula 3 and formula 2 and according to coulthard also had a very good first season in which he established himself the unknown however was the comparison with teammate nikita masepin schumacher was clearly in control of the latter though the haas was too slow to compete with other cars but with the arrival of magnussen and the better performance of haas there is now a comparison and in that schumacher is currently still inferior in kevin he now has someone he can only beat with hard work says coulthard preferring to highlight the danes performance rather than belittle that of his predecessor masepin the fact that hes consistently getting the haas into the points shows that it was the right decision to bring him back coulthard magnussen drives liberated but the fact that he currently has such a grip on schumacher also surprises the former vice world champion he explains it in such a way that magnussen had actually already finished with formula 1 and is now getting another unexpected second chance in which he has nothing to lose it seems he is driving liberated he says in his first career with mclaren and haas there was always some anger in his style now however magnussen is simply driving consistently well and is 31 up against schumacher in both qualifying and race duels go to overview mick has had it quite easy against masepin so far but now he has realised that he has a fast teammate in kevin and that has pushed mick he has to step up now said coulthard i think its a fascinating battle it will be interesting to see how haas will develop no very cool thanks how do you find out about the pop ups the race is lewis outmatched by guanyu a sith drip lord boy got drip cannot deny what lot is that sneakerheads yes mate my fashion finally lewis has real competition this year looks pretty normal other than the yarn on the shoes gaahdamnnn boy lookin flyy he looks like a aston martin fan prada drip with the dunks is the left leg of his trousers cable tied to his shoe zhougattit my dude has lh in shambles js his trousers remind me of ones your mum would buy for school to grow into big adam sandler energy in this one is that a real estate salesman in hot pursuit the entire bag is filled with coke back to the 70s daniel i just picked an outfit of the rack kind of forgot these were american sized mediums looks like someone is cocaine boss slight scarfacevibes dudes got to be roasting in those pants the pants and shoes combination is just not giving i am going to the best naturally dressed guy for me is zhou always hard fits without overdoing it for a moment there i got brought back to narcos mexico and thought i was looking at the character amado carrillo fuentes not bad danny boy not bad looks like cocaine dealing adam sandler the bag hes carrying has 003 tag nice touch he looks fine as hell ricciardo vs lewis vs zhou three way battle for the drip championship color scheme and patterns nice fit nope wiry f1 frame needs closer cut clothing florida man has arrived how to look broke wearing 10k worth of clothing sorry danny that are not it he just has like zero drip lh vibes naked face and still giving lewis a run for his money got that ron burgandy vibe rock them silk pajamas where is the swimming pewl hot brown did he roll up in a white testarossa grandpa a picture of something that is not hamilton sign me up just stumbled out of bar where he slept one off that backpack kind of ruins the look he looks like the doctor from idiocracy getting his win this weekend fellas cannot wait until mclaren cuts this guy get my guy some ac did bro dirty lmao that mercedes has sidepods xd are those the old tyres why do they look so weird that thing is in the background i know what it is i also know that no one was asking my hand shot up faster than a fat kid asking for seconds its called flys eye dome and it was designed by buckminster fuller this is a recreation in the courtyard of the art museum i first saw it at art basel miami side pod merc side pod merc side pod merc damn there is no way its that hot there where at in miami what\\' s with the w13 the floor is different the previous side pods but on the other hand a new and much thinner rear wing here is hoping they dial back the sensationalism somewhat seems like some drivers and teams are pretty upset about last season and less footage is not going to help them they definitely could have made a more compelling ie true story out of last season i think one episode will be about the rivalry between latifi and walls i feel like best case scenario is they mend some bridges with a less sensationalised season 5 and season 6 goes back to what it once was otherwise it will just be red bull steiner christian horner zak brown geri horner danny ric and christian horner by the end guaranteed that miami gets its own episode hopefully the series reinvents itself because it desperatly needs to the quality has been on a decline since s1 steady at first with s2 then sharper with s3 and off a cliff with s4 season 4 was for sure the weakest but hopefully they f1 liberty fom take any criticism from fans and the teams to refine the format i just need toto to say pumpernickel once an episode i do not think its an unreasonable request i am pretty sure by the end of those 2 seasons no drivers will be willing to participate they have not been happy with their portrayal on the large this last season was so bad i hope they rethink how they are doing things i hope the attrocious reception of the latest season prompts them to dial down the fake drama and focus on the real stuff a bit more i cannot fathom how they managed to fuck up the last season the perfect material for a banger of a season was right there and instead they focused on mazepins early pitstop they also manged to anger some drivers which could have been easily avoided hell ask some of them about their best moments and tough battles and you might even start endearing yourself to them will buxton on twitter 2 more years of having to hear about people who hate the series so much that they will not watch they should expand the number of races episodes hope 5 6 are better than 4 that last one was a snorefest i am here for more haas episodes season v guenther strikes back hopefully they will take some of the criticisms on board and focus on storylines that are actually happening instead of just manipulating the footage and the interviews to tell whatever narrative they want to tell and while were wishing for far fetched things i want a date with gahyeon from dreamcatcher cannot wait to watch about heroic prince charles slaying the satan max next season here is to 2 more seasons that releases during the season opener rather than the season break where it would be more sensible to watch formula 1 gatekeepers in shambles it is pretty early to confirm and for the first time it comes with 2 seasons do we know what happened in the meeting between drivers and netflix i enjoyed the series but i am really really hoping that geri horner is boycotting s5 s6 i had to ff through so much country life footage last season no surprises but christ they need to step up the content quality oh no its getting worse each season i think that they should do a second netflix show that is more serious dts is a great hook but there is room for more content it would be really cool if they could do a deep dive and follow one time for a whole year by the 6th season all the drivers will not want to be featured so it is going to be all actors pretending to be the drivers with 100 made up storyline\\'s and another 2 seasons of manipulative pictures of f1 cannot wait to not watch here is to hoping they stop with the fabricated bullshit when they have enough content to produce a good series with the drama they already have and less susie wolff please it is drive to survive not manage to survive still do not understand why we need more fake drama in newer seasons if its mainly to attract new fans are they going to start the show from season 5 as someone who does not give a fuck about this show let me just do my old man moaning why the fuck am i getting a breaking news push notification on my formula one racing app to tell me some netflix show is coming back for another two seasons ugh another thread of copy and pasted comments in every netflix thread like an actual game of reddit bingo i have liked every season enough they do not owe me anything the show is what it is if you do not like the format then stop watching just realised if they continue down the route of overdramatisation they are probably going to use landos sarcastic comments in some stupid convoluted way should set the record straight on how the powers that be feel about the series lot of people were using vague reports to insinuate that the series was unpopular and done for dts has been an overwhelmingly positive thing for the sport and for the smaller teams and lesser known drivers in particular if you watch the episodes of a single topic from all seasons back to back the ones with gasly gunther haas cyril and ricciardo really stand out as amazing pieces of work i am really looking forward to the future seasons hope they make more time for williams alfa and the shenanigans at aston martin hope it documents the races a bit more and the way it sways from race to race rather than make up rivalries and force things on us do not mind the bts stuff if it actually includes more stuff about the car and ermmm the racing aspect season 4 was average given the season was crazy original res photo needs a box for cutting away from the on track action to look at some clueless celebrities in a teams garage i like these but sad no rain related space i do not like how many squares are based on final race results all the pre and midrace squares more interesting if someone has too many squares based on final results there is no point playing here is the link to the prediction competition sad no latifi crash at turn 16 my prediction from all the preweekend talk you could have \"fake water\" as the free space them showing the yacht party with the fake water on tv miami puns column 3 is looking good the pitlane chicane looks like its asking for trouble mediums are pretty decent most races vscs have been pretty common and i favour vettel as a driver over stroll also poor latifi and sainz they just cannot catch a break all the best welsh dragon that was informative huh i did not realize the adjustment guns were designed to only rotate a predetermined amount but it makes sense i wonder if they have a setting on them where they can add more if the gun jumps out of the head or if the guns are smart enough to not turn when there is not a load this is super interesting are there any other teams or maybe drivers on tiktok would love this kind of content on my feed aston has a very good social media presence for their behind the scenes stuff not a fan of the team but i am subscribed to their youtube channel for all of the videos they put out great share rspecializedtools i really do love the behind the scenes looks that tiktok has brought us it is stuff that even 5 years ago would have been invisible to the average viewer just because nobody thought to cover it i need a lot more content like this the irony of tiktok a platform filled with teenagers and kids being where f1 teams showcase this kind of technical stuff is really funny i always wonder what they meant by 1 and 2 etc for wings like is it cm mm or just whatever unit they use and can they go 05 maybe the changes do not look too drastic i am curious as to how that small angle affects the aero load on the fw gif will not open commenting to find it later i have never wanted tiktok before and now suddenly i discover i need it damn you aston martin and your super cool informative clip that was cool as fook but i am pretty sure during race pit stops andor indycar they use something akin to an allen wrench great video except that tic tok thing at the end cannot they just get max there to bend it a bit the first and last step are missing first ask permission from lawrence stroll and at the end have the correction approved by lawrence stroll this special tool a bit driver f1 you are cool but you are not building the iron man suit or performing magic lol we know what a bit driver is most of us even have one in the garage showing a 403 error to me anyone got a mirror link its crazy how much more hype he gets over someone like palou who won indy last year and is leading this year lot of work to do if he wants to reach f1 is he quick no doubt but hes also erratic and prone to unforced errors nashville 2021 long beach 2022 barber 2022 etc if he can consistently unlock his speed without mistakes hes got a chance but not many drivers can colton is great but hes got some real early 2018 verstappen vibes about him id say pato oward is a better candidate for a potential seat at mclaren but then again if its an american they are specifically looking for original res photo wonder why he is not in the car for a practice session this weekend o\\'ward is a better driver i am going to so much hype for someone who is still learning to keep his shit together when racing for big points herta is an awesome driver and talent do not get me wrong but hes still a bit far from being a nice suit for mclaren in the near future id love to see him in f1 but id also love for him to first get more consistent in indycar hes such a 2019 charles leclerc right now mega fast but error prone and hotheaded this mans rapid and needs to replace ricciardo once his contract runs down mclaren are disappointed with how ricciardo performed last season citing they do not pay him a large contract to be underperforming the team is firmly centred around lando norris a delighted zak brown exclaims he should get sl first to think about f1 plus without at least one season in f2 i do not see his potential f1 time as a success story stop trying to make colton herta happen it is not going to happen the grid is really young i do not think it will be anything easy to get anyone much less him a seat if his somehow turns out to be 45 i can think of 2 major companies that would throw money at his team move over heinekenthe las vegas f1 title sponsor is let us not rush a us driver into a seat due to the growth in the us flat brim helmet how to spot a dutch person 101 not wearing a helmet when cycling original res photo going out for a rip to scout the track better slam the stem do we really need to post every single tweet on the subreddit why is this something worthy of posting by bike this puzzles confuses and enrages the american yes and lewis has just woken up and took shit deleted not worth posting to be honest what does bame stand for this is always controversial on one hand yes there absolutely should be more of an emphasis inclusion of nonwhite youth but it never goes well when there is mandatory spots for someone who has something that is basically just cosmetic different about themself people will just say \"oh he is only here because he is \" is he sponsored by winchester edit nm his son is no it should not we should live in a socialist meritocratic society where the background of some people are not tied to its past and were black people and some other minorities are not always in the backfoot compared to white people in the west though asians do not count since they are on the same wealthy and educational level or higher than white people removed meanwhile the williams are trying to get rid of it lol engineers working day and night to reduce weight of that merc design team its free real estate because of the new nft thingy car going to be 0001 sec slower because that paint people do realise this is vinyl and not paint right original res photo funky i am loving the miami color schemes i hope the mclaren \"leaked\" special livery will be used a special livery oh god we are going to beef for p19 and p20 then that will look good in victory lane sunday for a team in as much strife as mercedes it does seem a bit of a meme they are adding paintstickers while others are removing it are the really that important for a works team i was hoping for neon wheel covers but all right for those not wanting to open up twitter norris posted a couple of pictures of his helmet for miami his helmet is a basketball mercedes has photoshopped his helmet to replace the basketball in an imagine of jordan dunking one of the replies was really good original res photo slam dunk do what you want with those words merc admin do be killing it lately its an upside down alligator i am just saying that 3rd drs zone looks really short it will be interesting to see if it is long enough to give some good overtakes so is there any team that favors this circuit long straight looks like redbull power train are the minisector lengths determined by the amount of time it takes to complete them honestly looks like it could be a cool layout via adam cooper some small tweaks from the fia to the miami drs zones even before the cars have run detection 1 is 7m later d2 is 3m earlier and d3 is 4m earlier meanwhile activation 1 is 37m earlier feels a bit weird having the first two drs detection and activation points on the same straight given the corners preceding them are the very sort where the trailing car will lose time just before t78 and just after t13 feels like it would work better from a racing perspective i swear the track is rotated differently on every map i see why is the corner in ms04 not a corner but the straight on ms09 have a corner 9 i always wondered how circuit length is determined exactly my guesses were centerline length or average of inner and outer white line length guess they use the centerline i will save this pic handy to know for when i am following the mini sectors on the timing app this circuit actually looks really cool id love to see elevation changes but some of the curves are a real classic design drs 12 could be huge for someone turn 10 is going to be flat out and i cannot understand why you would even call that a turn why does not the map have the pitlane you would think that an fia map would have something that important lol new circuit map link to official fia document edit for reference here is the old circuit map its nice that the drs detection points are all after a corner rather than before so you cannot play drs games on the brakes in the same way they did in jeddah for example as you will lose out on the longer flat out sections after the detection points so they are longer why now i am scared of too easy overtakes even more will be changed again if it does not help toto enough why is f1 making drs zones in to gimmicks two zones is fine but for some reason they are adding more and more to make artificial overtakes and drama speaks to the failure of these new regs rulemakers were saying drs could well be eliminated with the new ruleset no drs on the showcars for a reason right instead drs is more than ever before do not fall for the nonsense folks all for the spectacle i guess miami needs to be an overtake fest these drs zones especially between 911 and 1617 seem way too powerful i do feel the corner being so much more open visually on the inside with the wall moved back will encourage some to send it its a lot less intimidating the last 5 cars are quite musical e a a e doubt they lift still kind of like it honestly if i had not been reading about the renovations i doubt i would have even noticed anything was different aside from the bigass grandstands of course friendly reminders from 2021 of why changes are necessary i am drooling i doubt they will lift in a formula 1 car but still the new look to the radillion corner is very good its got the same fearsome character as it was before but with a stand looking down onto the corner those got to be the best grandstand seats ever right i suppose it is a little bit different lol it is the same kind of even the gt3s look fast af f1 needs some more static camera angles like this not those 400 too far zoomed in tracking shots i could watch that shit all day i remember the good old days find somoene that looks at you like toto looks at christianmax make sure guenther and kevin do not drink too much or stuff might get fook smashed everywhere are opening parties something that is done for every tracks first race weekend or is this just cuz its miami never knew this was a thing before a race weekend what you doing step fred seb looks slouchy lol i am actually surprised so many poster designs went with vaporwavesynthwave i was hoping more of the posters took an interest in art deco architecture cuban influences or even pastel beach scenes hell nobody even did a proper miami vice throwback lol the cliches just keep on coming was hoping for checo firing off an m16 and max doing a line off the front wing runixporn has better vaporwave art than this i definitely like the way they have gone with the poster synthwave i believe but still its really nice this one is nice haas still wins no questions asked everyone complaining about the same theme from all the teams but i am loving it keep them coming i wish teams did more oneoffs throughout the season than they already do especially with helmets some of them seem so bland for the season and only get creative in the oneoffs love the synthwave vibe does anyone know if you can buy these somewhere i am excited for the inevitable comparison video that shows how inaccurate the codies version is they have managed to create a track before it was built yet they still have not managed to completely rebuilt spa going to look so realistic with porposing keep landos head away from zhou this is kind of hilarious i like the basic design and lack of sponsors love the touch of his signature as the commissioner it must be weird going to hold this helmet expecting to feel the grippy leathery texture of a basketball and instead feeling the cold slick texture of bare carbon fibre love that he did something other than the neon pink and palm trees that everyone else is doing goofiest helmet design yet i love it this is so cool it is almost stupid props to mclaren as well for giving that much artistic freedom this is a really cool concept and design is there a reason for this though is lando a huge basketball fan or cross promotion with nba finally an original design if lando gets another podium and all the mechanics congratulate him by tapping on his helmet during parc ferme its essential a basketball game man is going to look like a gta character they should paint the t cam into mj\\'s palm so it will look like he is bouncing a basketball down the main straight its genuinely so awesome i hope he raffles it away like he did his monaco helmet wow that is good nice to see a big difference in helmet designs from normal like it used to be that is slightly insane damn it looks like real ball that is hideous i love it so much went from to it looks so real the halloween pumpkin helmet is totally happening irl soon right right edit missing word helmet love lando for this i can smell this helmet through the internet winner really that is awesome and will look great in the orange mclaren also many drivers got the pinkblue on their helmets so this one really standsout a lando superb design and a brilliant idea really cool this is sick i love when drivers do full concept special helmets like dany riccs football helmet design for austin a couple years back instead of just adjusting the color scheme with a few design tweaks this fits so well with the mclaren color scheme as well wow well done i am overwhelmed with different emotions i do not know if this is my favourite this weekend but it is the most memorable this is perfect especially with the heat up 20 in the series okay i am impressed with lando for going for that helmet design that is so awesome this is so smart i love it cooooool would definitely grab a miniature of this if one is ever made can i ask a silly question does this come out of the teams annual budget i think is the most creative helmet design that i have ever seen looks great best helmet this year aiyooo that is fucking awesome this is cool af love it that is one of the coolest helmets i have ever seen love it this is the best and funniest helmet design i think i have ever seen i am not normally one to comment on another mans helmet but that my friends is stellar i fuck with this it was a tad jarring at first but the more i looked at it the more i liked it really different and really cool baller insanity wow that is amazing really perfect pretty cool how the lines are reminiscent of his usual design one of the best helmet design right now for me i could not believe it at first it looked like they actually attached the leather of a basketball to the helmet wow this is legitimately one of the best helmet designs i have ever seen this makes me very uncomfortable i meanthis is sick i love his helmets this one is great just like the pizza helmet nailed it such a simple idea ratbge go heat might be my all time favorite design mclaren is lucky there is porpoising otherwise they would be penalized for traveling is not someone at mclaren a part owner of the phx suns or something like that there in the playoffs right now so maybe that is y he has a basketball helmet lmfao just wait til we see hes got a custom race suit too i hate this with ball my heart not sure if intentional but a cool touch i noticed is how the seams of the basketball design is similar to the blue lines of his regular helmet the rnba rformula1 crossover we all need hahahawtf what a bizarre idea and its freakishly well executed me\"lando norris will never be ballin\\'\" lando norris brooooooooooooooooo this is absolutely caked in cool ok that is legitimately the best racing helmet i have ever seen i kneel sick nah this is goated my god it is it is beautiful that could have very easily looked like shit but its so painstakingly accurate and detailed that i think it works i like it a lot much better than the boring 80s neon miami vice gta style ones this would not have made sense if the race is in seattle rtihi haha this is so much ratbge ratbge i do not know this is like ratbge material to me it just seems wrong you need a better picture for the first one i literally thought it was a basketball with visors tape to it i like it it is not like basketball is something exclusive from miami but at least is not another vaporwave design and it is not crowded with spam like the one from my man alonso good old ourlando florida would make a lot more sense for a race in indy but pretty cool wearing a basketball helmet outside of a football stadium is certainly a choice how many guys going to hit landos head like it was a ball that is a nice football ironically being held around the football stadium nowhere near the miami heat or basketballs of any kind kind of cool but kind of ugly lol does the world think of miami as a basketball town genuine question and kind of hilarious if so why though ratbge and he answered super bowl instead of nba finals clincher court side it disturbs me how realistic this is id hate going to touch it and it feeling smooth and hard not bumpy with some give we got to see danny ric\\'s but i think it is safe to say lando wins the helmet race it is so cool but it bothers me sooooooo much that the panels are wrong ball is life cannot say i am a fan of this one landos helmet max does not need one he just shaves his head bald and paints it to look like a football helmet checo one the other hand will put a helmet around his helmet because hes scared but max is not he does not fear anyone or anything for that matter helmut marko probably i like the idea but i do not like how it looks hes gone from tennis ball to basket ball this is unbelievably cool though goddamn this has to be the sickest helmet design i have seen in a long time ok this is actually one of my favourite helmet designs from him ever this is spot on this is so cool lmaoo i do not really like it but it is definitely very well done ratbge aweful taste but great execution i hope everyone on the grid calls him \"basketball head\" all weekend a la hey arnold hot damn that is a good lookin lid its revolting well done did not he answer superbowl over nba finals in the would you rather video that is originaland pure good thing we can still have this kind of design for once without 5000 sponsors desecrating the design philosophy or someone complaining about his trypophobia or something the ugliest helmet i have ever seen kind of hilarious though as an american i love that f1 drivers come to america just to fucking let loose and do all the goofy things wow very nice amazing basketball sucks 57 perfect score my god it is hideous ew lmao everything about this gp is cringeworthy ready to score a three pointer race it triggers my trypophobia i hate it i like it ratbge possibly the coolest and most original design i have seen will definitely stand out great job to the artistdesigner the least aerodynamic helmet on the grid should have saved the design for one of the mercedes or ferrari drivers can just imagine them bouncing up and down the straight lol i want to dribble it this looks amazing ratbge edit subbed in the wrong direction coming from the guy who does not know what city the lakers play for lmaoo fugly i hate it lando magic ummm no horrible epic and yet gasly met mj lame why is the lamest sport in america invading f1 this is stupidi said it ducks least fav of the weekend but concept is admittedly a little cool my eyes its at a football stadium what does it actually have the raised bumps it looks like it with the way the light is reflecting on some of those pics it looks like when you mess up the air bladder in the ball lol i am not sure if i absolute hate or absolutely love this it is definitely one or the other whole grid is going to have a special helmet at this point lol bro no fucking way lmao i can feel it with my eyes i doubt this is why lando went for this particular design but the nba playoffs are happening now and espnabc has a big chunk of the broadcast rights and they will be airing the race so it works as a crosspromotion for disney as well which i am sure they will mention and appreciate damn that is astrometric that texturing though that is fucking awesome the detail is incredible blursed that looks really cool i think looks like a real ball amazing someone needs to put this on tradingpaints immediately do you think he likes basketball this is truly awful and i love it le mau this is actually disgusting but its done so well lmao lewis and charles should be wearing it boing boing boing i had no clue they got helmets for specific grand prix i just thought they used the same one new meaning for bouncing on the track bruh noooo way should have put the miami heat logo on it let us go heat pretty sweet helmet but let the porpoising begin i read the first two words quickly as nandos the colour of the helmet does not help nor the texture i think maybe i should lay off the chicken for a while i love lando this helmet is awesome but the child in me is hoping danny ric takes a marker writes \\'end\\' next to the giant bell logo on the back kind of cool but kind of ugly lol whoever painted it did a phenomenal job the texture looks so realistic all that work and money for him to dnf interesting to not show the front lol my helmet has a sticker on it saying that i cannot paint it or add any stickers to it or it will no longer be effective how tf did they do this was it tested at all bruh all fun and games until instincts take over and ricciardo tries to dunk landos head he wins the best helmet ever award that is one of the coolest helmet design i have ever seen suns in 4 straight this is awesome move it basketball head this is my favourite helmet ever i like how they made it look bumby without it actually being bumby i wish it was bumpy though lerbonjanes you like what you see some people in the comments who do not think this is cool what is cool to you i do not understand how this relates to miami it is not really a basketball city the miami heat have had empty seats all throughout the playoffs that is fuckin rad that as the kids say is dope friking awesome move it football head no miami heat logo is there any backstory of why its a basketball themed head like a fuckin orange that is beautiful my favorite helmet i have seen so far what is that plastic thing on the back of the helmet for best helmet so far i love it so cool now this is next level cannot believe it is right in my backyard and cannot go drivers will do anything to get a signature from mj to be honest i would do the same heat culture baby i mean that is incredible this is just good moneysaving by mclaren recycle and reuse outfuckingstanding this is one of the most completely random helmet designs of all time and i am here for it it was designed by a guy called mdm designs you should check out their facebook he does quite a few drivers designs baller if it was a videogame helmet paintjob you could change this would be the annoying one developers give everyone for free as an incentive to buy better ones for money nba jaaaaaaam lando confirmed for the remakeif it ever happens lmao \"genuine leather\" let us go heat rtrypophobia wilsoooonnn basketball helmet at a football stadium cannot blame him though the heat actually win albon trying to explain bear grylls i want a whole video of people explaining shit to charles after seeing people explain smoothchunky peanut butter and bear gryllis to him i can almost guarantee it was lando with the boom mic crofty in the background blagging a free williams shirt this is one of the best videos i have seen f1 put out recently really enjoyed it 19 drivers miami is great i am enjoying the golfbasketballbaseballfootball max its all about the race yeah absolutely love this format it is informal but it does not feel forced to me the drivers seem chill spontaneous not easy with a camera in their face and knowing it will be shown to the world lol sidenote change my view or not based on looks charles is the most beautiful driver in the history of f1 my fav bits are drivers greeting their exbosses i know its such a small thing but still love to see it nonetheless sebfranz georgejost carloszak of course yuki talks about the food the man lives for it my pride hearing charles say in america you feel like anything is possible \\'murica one of the funniest videos f1 has done for a while max really is all about the racing russell looks like the most generic dude on the planet look up man in the dictionary and see the picture if you look closely lewis is actually trying to push against it and drown the w13 in the sea the cars fucked perspective makes it difficult for me to appreciate the rest of the poster i really like the paintbrush strokes in the sky though lewis with the initial d pose crockett and tubs just putting this out there mercedes produced shit posters in the past 4 races and their results were equally poor now there are news about car upgrades in miami and this poster actually looks decent mercedes 1 2 god souria really knocks it out of the park with these i am so glad to see she is getting recognition and work in the industry if anyone wants to see more of her work you can find her soudraws on twitter russell looks like the safety instructions card guy onboard much about any airline has some miami vice vibes nicely drawn poster the water looks exactly as it does in the marina looks like the car is up on an invisible front jack in no other team posters 2022 budget restrictions scream so loud to be honest it looks stuffy and kind of lame compared to the others hams face in this poster has that ah shit here we go again vibe i wonder who the artist is because that is really good this poster is brilliant just absoloutely amazing hopefully their car is as good as their poster ah a poster to match the car they produced so bad my brain hurts when i look at the rear right and front right and there is a palm tree on the sea oh wait it was not a sea right still nice looking poster feel like this is what alpha tauri wanted theirs to be lol i like the art style of it love the pre race posters the teams do they are trying everything is so bad with merc this year haas did it first and better could someone better in photoshop than me please add some dolphins jumping in the water edit maybe also take out that monster palm tree out in the ocean you can literally see how excited they are to drive the w13 from their faces russell has frank grimes energy the car actually looks like its bouncing i am impressed wow they totally got bottas looking wrong again george russell as the front figure of the poster what is going on here its definitely the right move to make from the fia to show that it is in support of the because to provide as much help as possible to get ukraine fully rebuilt after this horrific stuff is over original res photo fia statement removed ah finally something creative and sans blue purple bottas and zhou are wearing the same suits as james crockett and riccardo tubbs on the poster of the original miami vice tv show a refreshing design after seeing all the vaporwave bluepink posters and promos for the last few weeks alfa always delivers with these same as ferrari til miami has a flag glad to see the indian grand prix return i do not know its miami flag or indian flag these motherfuckers do not miss biiiig tintin vibes in this one zhou and bottas look so good in this art style miamindia alfa romeo always set a high bar for a poster and this is just amazing definitely got a tintin vibe about it with the art direction of the drivers this is a wholesome poster it makes me think that bottas zhou have bought a house and are about to settle down together alfa romeo posters one of the greatest really wish i could buy them it looks like we might have gotten a sneak peak at bottas helmet for the weekend too why does vb look like an adult caillou random indian flag is random edit i lived in south florida for nearly 2 decades and had no idea that miami had a flag or what it looked like fun fact miami\\'s flag is older than india\\'s flag 1933 and 1947 respectively alfa nailing the poster game again is the indian gp coming back looks like a tintin special closest well ever get to an indian grand prix now i guess damn this one is really great the better poster for miami gp i was wondering why there is an indian flag there then i saw the palm tree never knew that miami has its own flag bottas looks like tintin tintin i scrolled past thinking that is the indian flag that is a beautiful poster they win this round love the references to miami vice don bottas d at first i was thinking what the fuck does the indian flag have to do with miami alfa aesthetic is just always on point i do not understand the indian flag s what is the other flag looking almost like the indian national flag this just has a lovely vibe to it they put a drop shadow on grand prix but forgot it on miami tintin goes to miami really thought that was the indian flag for a second until i payed closer attention and looked up miami flag all i can see with bottas outfit is robin williams in the birdcage am i the only one who sees a tintin style going on with how much they want the track to be monaco its pretty ironic that their flag is basically just indias there you go the real kings of poster design shows the way once again enough of the miami vice inspired posters ugh the roaring 2020\\'s that is raw what is up with all the custom designed stuff for this race its it because the track is new outer is this going to happen every year thought this was last shadow puppets fan art for a moment tintin it looks like dale gribble as bottas got confused for a second thinking that was an incorrect representation of the indian flag google told me that is miami city flag reminds me of the movie the birdcage lol is that the couple from the birdcage is that bobby hill this reminds me of the poster with the weird butt why does not this sub put as much effort into art with all the other tracks lol lovin it though classiest of them all what have they done to bottas nice to see a poster styled from before the cocaine days people were hating on the alfa livery but it looks really good even when its not lined up my favorite for shure thought it was the indian flag for a quick second work by jalcalara they have done several alfa posters previously in this gorgeous ligne claire style wtf indian fags whata f love this style very tintinesque buddh international autodrome alfa romeo designers do not miss do they at least someone is graphic designer is sticking to the non crypto design scheme okay it is a comic in a country with a rich comic book history not an i the only one who thinks that the style is more francobelgian comic than american i get strong tintin vibes here but looks really nice such a beautiful poster i wish manor had managed to hold on they always did good work man those clothesi am in florida and this morning humidity at my house hit 90 and it is 95 degrees outside right now this is giving me some real tintin vibes i love it tintins adventure at the miami grand prix credit as a general rule see full rules a standalone discussion post should be of interest to the sub in general and not a specific userbase eg new users gp attendees just yourself be able to generate discussion eg no yesno or easily answerable questions show reasonable input and effort from the op if not be sure to look for the daily discussion rformula1s daily open question thread which is perfect for asking any and all questions about this sport thank you for your cooperation and enjoy the discussion i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorformula1 if you have any questions or concerns i do not think people really appreciate how difficult producing a live event for television is when the \"most important thing right now\" is constantly unclear in contrast to football or baseball or basketball where the ball is always the top priority no offense but this post kind of screams of \"i do not really know what i am talking about but i am going to tell people how to do it anyway\" i do not think \"f1 producer\" is a real job overarching job that involves the same people inrace and in this preevent and creating the graphics and for the intro event i am sure there were some time constraints in place that they had to adhere to obviously you are still free to have your opinion and some of your points are valid but i think there is a lot of confusion on what some of these people do and do not do the intro party was just that an introduction i am not sure why you expected teams to be interviewed or anything like that to be honest they really should have just put the teams out without having them make a statement which would have made the whole thing cleaner the only real issue i had with it was a clear lack of direction seemed like crofty had to steer the ship like an mc which was pretty weird for this kind of event race broadcast complaints are just silly honestly the races are live and the people broadcasting can only see so much from their angles they do not always know when there is an ontrack battle going on when a decision is made to cut to replay or change angles its generally too late to cut to something else i could not enjoy it because they kept rushing everyone in and out making it very obvious that they were under very strict time restraints my guess is the time restraints had to do with wanting a nighttime vibe without having a latenight noise permit like zak brown which was the only american on the stage sad otmar noises i think the replays of the start have become such a thing because recent history has shown the race is won or lost on the start hopefully as the racing on track gets better and cars can now follow more closely and even pass the broadcast will adapt to that and show less start replays you can also replace f1 producers with fans fans sometimes do not understand what the fans actually want and would benefit from the most not saying you are wrong but fans make the stupidest requests most of the time quite odd how you portray your own personal opinion as what the fans want you are not speaking for everyone else with these arguments so do not act like you are i am a fan too and i prefer the broadcast to stay like it is f1 should just let fans run everything i am sure it would be great what you did not enjoy looking at sainz blank stare instead of watching leclerc rejoining the track after norris last race not just the start replays what drives me through the wall is the need to show the crowds reacting to a drivers battle over the actual action on track i do not want to watch the crowds and miss the action i am not asking for much an opening ceremony or launch party for a race event is ridiculously over the top and why a lot of people were cringing when vegas was announced that is going to be so much worse a level of cheese on a grand scale i cannot wait for liberty to sell up when they have milked the sport for all it is worth completely agree about ridiculous start replays when there are still opening lap battles going on i can understand that midrace sometimes the most interesting moment is missed but it should still be done better as well i think that live timing with laps and sectors should be either free or very inexpensive data access is big for f1 fans who stick around finally more wide shots rather than tracking cars from very close which removes the sensation of speed its not a good look when amateur videos from smartphones provide better viewing than professional broadcast oh and same goes for filtered flybuzzing car engine sound understanding a fans perspective and adhering to it is one area the sport really needs to learn in order to grow the media that covers f1 is very entrenched in the sport they have been around for decades because of this often without realizing i think they carry the exclusivity and elitism the sports history is entrenched with f1 under its previous management viewed themselves as an elite rich prosperous group and marketed themselves to that select few as the world has become more digital there is a switch in where people go to get there sports coverage think barstool vs espn i think part of f1s hesitancy in embracing this change is they very much like to control the narrative i do not know the solution because for them as an entity there are extreme benefits to being able to control the narrative or the story you better get ready for 60 of the race to be fan crowd shots this weekend tv director has been shocking for a while i am going to most over in rindycar suggest penske has been eyeing up an endurance race since he bought ims could also just be a courtesy visit i would love it if f1 came back to indy i attended a few races back in the early 2000\\'s when they were there and would love to go back with my wife for a race she is only interested in f1 no other racing unfortunately is he penske material the scenes if the us gets a fourth race at indy the antiamerican squad going to have to be on suicide watch before the comments flood in f1 is not and has no reason to go to indy in 2020 penske said he was interested in f1 but that no serious talks were happening this was back when a fia official went to see the indianapolis motor speedway facilities i am going to assume the same situation remains neither penske nor f1 is interested i guess penske is bussy with indycar and there is not that much money for f1 in indiana i do not know i for one would hope indy comes back eventually why would not the head of the fia go see the head of indycar and the most famous circuit in the us original res photos photo photo 2 photo 3 cota indy and long beach would be the ideal 3 usa race calendar f1 indy 500 just for the lols penske has little to no interest in hosting f1 he could literally be talking about anything 4th us race in 2023 confirmed \"you like money\" \"fuck yeah\" so he only sometimes wears a thawb i went to the miami eprix years ago formula e and got grandstand seats between the track and my grandstand were a line of trees so i could briefly see the cars zip down the straight between the trees for maybe a quarter second i wound up leaving my more expensive seat and watching the race from the general admission area karun chandhock spun right in front of me and maybe 15 feet apart we shared awkward eye contact its the ability to instagram it is what you are paying for honestly 1000 is pretty cheap by miami gp standards considering cheapest grandstands were 800 so i am not surprised you are basically paying for the experience of being somewhere near an f1 car while getting a tan and drinking beer brazil living the dream 150 for 3 days 25 beer 2 beverages ya but when are you ever going to feel the sand between your toes at an f1 race you think they care hint miami was not chosen because of its die hard fans you are paying for social media clout not to see the race uh you would probably stand up for the actual race is not it hard to judge without a view that is actually from the seats like they care they are there for the sand booze and because they heard that is the place to be in miami this wknd lol if you tell them the race is between the safety and medical car they will believe it lol just like the thousands of people who travel to coachella just for vibes you bet your ass that the people who forked out 1000 for these beach chairs are not going to care much about the racing who cares most people there do not even know how f1 works its all about famous and rich people getting that instagram post with some champagne and networking from what i remember there is not a tv in this area the opposite side is surrounded by stands i think they will have to watch it on a tv in the hardrock club its not about seeing the cars its about being there and taking instagram stories if you sit at rascas or on your yacht in monaco you cannot see the cars very well either its about showing off hear the race live but watch it on tv from your beach chair still seems not bad these people probably are not there to see the cars anyway most of the people probably are not going there for the race anyway the most surprising part of this post to me is that those seats are only 1000 f1 could have had this race at the daytona or homesteadmiami road course god forbid people pay to actually watch a race and not just flex on the poors wait there is a race everything about consuming this race in person is a total shit show it leaves me concerned for the vegas gp am i the only one thinking there is not an actual safety barrier for the beach side did they not think of elevating it this is making the mistake of assuming the people who paid to be in this section are there for the race at this point i am just going to stop bitching and embrace the suck would not they be able to just stand up and be basically trackside i do not understand all the hate great planning lol in austria general admission tickets for the whole weekend are 110 and you can literally see half the track from there there is cars only in miami lol i imagine they will be up against the fence the people buying 1000 \"beach\" seats are not there to see the race the race is just the back drop to this particular social event for them its not a place to see the race but to be seen at the race how will they not be able to see the car if the track is right beside them cannot they just stand up during the actual race the prices for the race are ridiculous those are being seen not to actually see the race my first race 2000 bought ga seat was 40 feet from the cars at 200mph with perfect view oh yeah ticket was 30 ahh the good ole days cannot believe i just said that i have never felt the urge to go watch a gp live extreme cases like this aside will not you just get a better view of things at home its not about the money its about sending a message oh you think people whom book those seats are there to see the cars but those insta photos though why do people think anyone paying 1000 for hospitality tickets are going to watch the race on the track they will watch it on a tv at the bar if they watch it at all circuit de barcelona ga ticket 140 return flight hotel 380 5 night yes please i can sense some fyre festival vibes for those seats most people going to this event arnt there to see the cars imagine paying 1000 and see a wall but the people who pay 1000 for f1 probably do not even car for the f1 they will be in the vip area and drinking champagner and eating during the race anyway while i am sitting at the track 247 friday to sunday in spielberg with my 100 ticket to see f3 f2 and porsche and of course f1 this year it is over 100 for the first time let us hope that is real sand but you are missing the point everyone can see you i have been to 3 races and you can barely see any cars at any track having lived in miami for 4 years i can say this whole track and event is the epitome of miami flashy overpriced likely sub par quality welcome to miamithey do not care about the race its about showing off you paid for the seats i live in miami its the most fake city i have ever seen cannot wait to get back out games gone no that would have to be risen for 23 meters but for that the safetyfence is to low thank god cota is a proper race course there are multiple giant screens on track let us be clear the best way to view the actual gp is in front of your tv or your pc if you are using f1 tv account this is an experience you are next to f1 cars there is an electric mood beer food you name it its redicolus its a bad fake beach and it would be ears killer i am torn i want good racing because i will watching at home but all this fake lifestyle in the middle of a parking lot is making me sick and i do not want f1 returning and doing this all over again looks like a good spot to nap and have a beer is this next to the fake water that will complete the vibe all these people will be watching the race on a giant screen somewhere nearby the actual race is for ambiance deleted why would i want to seat on sand if there is no beach like sand is the bad thing about going to the beach which is what people who cannot afford a swimming pool do i thougt the yachts on fake water already did not make much sense but this is another level hardrock sucks this was a problem when singapore hosted there first race so much better off booking a high rise room for the weekend and watching from there miami gp taking inspiration from fyre i am sure things like this will get sorted for next year at least they are obviously a bit rushed this year this shit is turning into the new fyre festival its laughable if it is this fake i cannot imagine what vegas will be like how can you fuck up so badly lol yeah not many people attending the miami gp care about f1 that is ok the people buying those seats are not interested in the cars or racing anyway man as a new american f1 fan it really is a smack to the face i do not understand how f1 is expected to grow if they keep catering to a wealthier fanbase do i like more races coming to the us hell yeah do i like that two of them are now going to be in super tourist spots that the average joe will struggle to afford hell no does f1 as an organization want to grow or are they content with getting money from the rich deleted as an american i am already hating this gp there is a second floor in the beachclub if that cost more i do not know then again its not much to slag was at imola and they really do not do all they can either to ensure a good viewing experience f1 should really work with all the tracks a but over the next years to try improve it is the sand real at least cannot you just walk around and go watch somewhere else like at football games i always go to the fan zone party areas and watch from standing bar area nobody buying those seats cares what they are able to see only that they will be seen mrbeast new video place lmao the target customer are the celebs who barely give a fuck about the race anyway so it works out going to sell out either way most likely will not be able to see cars oh they will when carlos finds his way to the closest thing to gravel that this track has those seats are ment to be sold to influencers not real racing fans those seats are to be seen in not to see from something that caught my attention when esfand the twitch streamer went to cota was how many people did not come from racing rather they came for the experience cool people vibes drinks and watch cars too this is just an extension of attrack experience trying to attract that audience this is how influencer based marketing works see revolve fest coachella for example are we remotely surprised the race organizers only care how it looks on tv same with the people sitting there they just want to be seen there you are paying to share a space with beautiful rich people good deal i suppose if you want followers they have places like this in montreal too it is not a miami or us thing it is all and that is fine let those people enjoy that experience i will say being on track level and close is pretty cool too it is just a different way to experience the show is the sand even real that is why i always go in the back i know indy is considered low brow and all but for 1000 i am taking my father to indy 500 and sitting with a great view of the final turn and startfinish you could also toss in the hotel and rental car for fridaymonday and one of our fight tickets from minneapolis in that 100000 i really hope it rains lol bring on the chaos is not there a whole beech club they can probably watch from that deck i cannot wait for a rain to down pour on these seats are the races in europe this ridiculously expensive that track and its design around it is pure chaos cool spot but unless you are on a high pedestal you will will not be able to see shit looks like they will see plenty and moreso than that they look like what is on show for the grandstands when there is no action i those corners that would be so awkward to me to have thousands looking across at a few dozen in those beach chairs lol the f1 snobbery on here is something else if these seats are advertised as an up close and personal f1 experience and you cannot see shit then that is bullshit do not assume it is just women with fake breasts here for a holiday and an instagram photo i would pay a premium for beach seats where i could watch the race with a good site line if that is what these people were expecting then this is really shitty for them and you all should not be a bunch of cunts what am i missing why will not they be able to see over that wall this gp is a becoming a failure before it even starts i can see it now the youtube mini documentaries about the nightmare miami gp of 2022 fuuuuuck miami they are there to be seen not to see the race looks like they will be able to see just fine people there do not watch the race anyway they just want to be seen i would not worry about it the people that are going to spend tens of thousands for those stupid seats probably will not be able to tell you who michael schumacher or ayrton senna were either maybe they will remember nicky louder from that movie thor was in they will be looking at their phones all race anyway they will taste and see sand its crazy how they are in miami but those dumbasses could not get the race right next to the water meanwhile we have races in monaco so really was f1 just being cheap for mia lol would have been a cool opportunity to have cameras on the trackside barriers feeding to screens immediately behind crudely making an invisible wall i can go to midohio and see the indy race for like 60 the miami race has just lost the plot americans love overpriced sub par quality let them have it in peace better bring your own hyraulic ramp to see over the fence xd you can feel the speed duh bold of you to assume they care i get free tickets from some guy i know for the red bull ring every year he sponsors something or whatever no idea so many people are making out everybody who bought these tickets are there for social media likes people can be richer than average joe and still have just a big of interest in f1 as average joe it could be that they are taking their partners are are keeping all parties happy it could just be that they like the idea of this let people enjoy what they enjoy really cool i like it i feel like zhou ended up being the perfect 2 driver for alfa he has a very similar demeanor to bottas a bit quiet but seemingly a happy guy keeping his head down and just have great drives for his first season i keep putting money on him to get in the points siiick really starting to like zhou to be honest that is a nice helmet wow i love this danny ric vibes this is the one starting to really like this kid seems like he might have potential cool helmet too like it alot cool helmet good dude it has probably been said somewhere but why do all drivers have a special miami livery commercially interesting of course and it really looks like they were heavily influenced by a kind of blueprint of palm trees and happiness everybody get up its time to slam now my man included more basketball references than sponsor logos lol why does he have a busted knock off bugs bunny cartoon is it a logo in not familiar with that is one fucking sick lid man gaat damn that is really a slick design vibrant and really pops out at you aside from the playoffs being in full swing anyone know the deal with both lando and zhou having basketball features dope rip kobe what a great helmet design zhou hey can i put lola bunny on my helmet alfa we have lola bunny at home the lola bunny at home they all kind of look the same such a cool helmet and i am liking the basketball rabbit adding a nice cool touch soo good the colors pop so well and the sponsor logos are not overbearing a lisa frank binder with stickers f1 helmet edition does he sell them on scale can someone tell me how hes holding the helmet on the first pic is this guy a magician this is fucking sick sweet design he actually put his fursona on it the fucking mad lad guys i think he likes basketball love the space jam reference i like the \"totally not basketball bugs bunny from space jam due to international copyright law\" on the side nice touch how do i get a useable replica of this what does the chinese word mean on the basketball part very cool maybe a bit cluttered but its a lovely departure from the typical racing helmet designs all this miami stuff is going to severely damage my wallet with little dipshit and daddy gone haas seems like an entertaining and marketable team this is great news the idea is not ludicrous the company appears to have stability a 50 million or so marketing deal may bot be that outside their expansion plans and budgets 5his is definetly not a rich energy situation the kmag effect looking into their company sounds like a pretty solid sponsorship probably not going to be life changing for haas based on the size but who gives a fuck glad to see haas getting some new sponsorship haas going to the moon with a name like lunar i was so worried this was another crypto sponsorship thankfully its an actual bank that provides actual products and services i am sure this will work out so much positivity surrounding haas at the moment adding to that they have a very respectable package this year getting new sponsors on bord must have become a million times easier huh they had their logo on the car at previous weekends already why they announce it just now will it also be on f1tv with the announcement on sky i was hoping something in the us would pop up i will watch espn will broadcast live coverage of all qualifying and race sessions across their portfolio of channels including espn2 espn3 espnu and espnews very surprised espn is actually putting w series on their flagship stations my initial reaction was ok sure they will just throw it on espn and make people pay to stream it nice i have always wanted to be able to watch w series here i am in too good job some great broadcasting deals for the w series lately looks like more magisterial messi replays on bein great news excited to watch the only thing i see on the espn app right now is the spanish language broadcast hope they just have not gotten that squared away yet this is great news anyone from this group have a good shot at f1 fuck yes thank you anything to support these women yay i cannot for the life of me understand why f1 cannot seem to work it out for it to be on f1tv seems a bit of a nobrainer are there pictures of the cocaine chicane look at all the shadows on the road the surface does not look flat at all cannot wait to see ham bobblehead makes an appearance on the main straight curious as to why they have the last few starting boxes at an angle would not it be easier and more fair if these were straight or is there a required distance between the track edge and the grid box for crews to work ad such hold up i work for one of these companies and have not been offered hospitality tickets resignation incoming it seems so strange to associate autonation and gainbridge with f1 and not indycar aside from that i have been curious all year to see what michael schumachers cruise line is like this is probably the first time since the 70s or something that a grand prix has these many partners on the same track at the same time we got to bet on which barrier sponsors will latifi hit first space in sector 3 for reddit not too late so no zoom zoom zoom this weekend c i like this it means no part of the track looks similar so its easy to tell where the drivers are rear will snap into pirelli barriers if the promoters got their way it would be lewis hamilton is going through the heineken 00 corner presented by geico get the best insurance in the whole country glad to see mick sponsoring a part of the track there needs to be a carvana sponsorship boarding that is where latifi will crash carrying on for jimmie johnson i am surprised by an extent to which this community embraces sponsors you guys are genuinely excited about them and their ads i find it surprising because personally i despise every kind of advertising that is shoved down my throat and i actively block it from my consciousness like i do not acknowledge who the sponsor of given team or event is and you will not make me i am baffled by the fact that so many people have directly opposite point of view on this why do you care what about the space between gainbridge and aramco i am still not convinced gainbridge is a real company every track has a sponsor on every wall and corner but we have to complain this week because \"america bad\" huh ok fuck cryptocom i would rather see a wells fargo ad its like neoliberalism had a bender a threw up a f1 race track how is this shit content this is the most american thing i have ever seen in f1 these are the things that worry me about f1 in america everything is going to be sponsored was not expecting to see my former employer here will be a good way to see where the drivers are though why is there a nonalcoholic are we in saudi arabia or what gainbridge eh hmm so mow we get 17 unnecessary pop up adverts each lap is it me or do more indycar sponsors have placement here than cota how much more expensive is cota brand placement in comparison to miami cryptocom will drop billions on some cool shit for fun and mfs will still willingly use their service like you are being robbed by millennials right now lmao i cannot wait for this race my f1 team on f1 manager1996 after i start getting sponsors still do not understand why msc cruises have not tied up mick it is a natural fit surely this is detrimental to the sponsors themselves when there is a million different sponsors around the track they get drowned out individually ricciardo showed up at last year\\'s race dressed as a cowboy and did preshow donuts in a vintage chevrolet stock car later in the weekend cota hosted the world spameating championship how to get americans to care aye american here for the comments the posh stodgy european sport when your editor tells you to add in some british sounding adjectives just wanted to say very well written article for those who plan to read it nascar once tried to get a certain fanbase interested in their sport it worked but to the cost of all the die hard fans who felt betrayed on the sport that had left them that certain fanbase then left and nascar was without many of its die hard audience and without the audience it tried to get i worry that this is the way f1 is going now and in 10 or 20 years it will have been super popular and then drop off the radar well care for a minute not longer watch who knew all they had to do was increase ticket prices to 1200 plus dollars f1 needs to give some of us older american fans credit for having to explain what f1 was to people for so long anxiously awaits read out of stereotypes of an otherwise diverse socially and culturallyrich oecd nonauthoritatian nation of nearly 330m people by creating fake drama i do not understand why all these websites keep claiming that f1 \\'has cracked\\' the usa there is on average 1 million viewers per race for a country with over 300 million people this is not that much americans need a driver for the popularity to rise even further i understand why but its funny following a driver because you share the same nationality not his skills or character god i hope america does not start rubbing off on f1 but i fear it already has f1 was is and likely will be european centric sport just like indycar nascar nba and other us based series teams have factories there karting is better there as well despite liberty push for the us f1 still has more fans in europe despite gaining tracks in america 2 more in miami and las vegas neither european fans come to for example indy and say that change to look more european i really hate articles like this because it makes me fight the urge to defend myself with not all of us are like this commentary but reading those comments are often equally as exhausting i do think there is a disassociation between the average american consumer and what is being marketed to us we are extremely aware of how on the nose the strategies are to reach us as the target audience and at least for the people i know were all typically just as embarrassed by the lack of nuance what are we to do i am not going to not watch a race just because its got this ridiculous pandering but at the same time f1 will look at a successful event and go see all this stuff we did is what the americans wanted wwe style contrived title battles and results not worth it thought it was a decent analysis of the american marketing machine churning right now around the miami gp regardless of personal feelings re americanization of the sportmedia around it cannot wait for all races to be hosted in middle east and america did they put guns on the cars just like everything else they had to dumb it down for them to understand bless their hearts \"why do the la clippers trade for 2 billion the nba is a great sport but it does not have a global reach and the clippers do not have 20 world championships to its name so why are they worth four times mclaren\" zak brown he has a very good point benchmarking f1 teams against us sports team is just the first step they ought to compare themselves to premier league football teams one day if not being the benchmark themselves for other global sports i mean f1 races are exclusively international in its reach read world championship f1 pride itself as elite and glamorous so why sell themselves cheap the advanced tech involved and amount of employees each team employs are mindnumbingly high and they are highly skilled to boot the skys the limit as an east coast american the best part of f1 are the 9am sunday morning start times wake up get some breakfast watch the race and then it is over by lunch and have the whole day left i actually do not like races in america for that exact same reason that is truly an awesome helmet design alonso has really nailed the use of the blue and the pink so perfectly gorgeous why the fuck could not bwt let them have this pink on their livery looks waaaayy better than their bland shitty version of pink the car should have used this 2 tones of pink and blue damned corporate colors such a cool helemt and then there is all the bwt crap all over it i am starting to hate this company i like very cool helmet nailed it with the palm trees and the lifeguard stations it is miami you got to\\' have \\'them the most authentic touch however is that green circle on the back it is a reference to the very rare \"green flash\" phenomenon that you might be able to see from the deep keys when the sun can be seen setting into the ocean that is brilliant brilliant love it some other angles miami pink i like 1010 but where is kimoa best helmet of the weekend bwt is comedy the publicity must work for them however not that i noticed skipped over their water filtration for the upcoming home build probably because i am so tired of seeing their pink everywhere i cannot honestly believe i am saying this as i love miami vice colors so much but damn i am tired of seeing it already helmets posters everything shout out alpha for their poster though very cool design hot shit the blue and pink combination we wanted but did not get on alpine so this is where alpines v a p o r w a v e aesthetic is holy fuck now that is vaporwave alpine west coast times practice 1 56 1130a 1230p practice 2 56 230 330 practice 3 57 1000a 1100a qualifying 57 100p 200p sunday race 1230p not fully sure this qualifies as a repost or not i feel his version of the american is not really applicable for the miami region i was expecting this american danny ricciardo ricky bubby direct link to video here hq geoblocked so only works for people either inside the uk or outside using a vpn connected to a uk server everyone else will get a 403 mirror link below danny playfully throwing shade to valtteri i would support ricky riccardo speaking for the entire weekend with an american accent acting like its perfectly normal and nothing has changed and ignoring any questions about it what the fuck i have never seen geoblocked videos on twitter before g fucking g sky sports lol that accent is just as foreign to miami as his aussie accent years later and danny still qualifies behind valtteri absolutely love it a little known fact is that every aussie gets honorary american status if they want it i hope we get a focused trying to beat his teammate daniel this weekend the least funny driver on the grid most australians do not even see him as one of us anymore anyway they can have him honestly i do not i find it super annoying you mean the best photo of your life according to crofty opening party what else does a race weekend consist of that i have no idea i hate that i cut off seb in this pic he is always been my favorite i also got some good shots of lewis george and charles but i do not have an imgur account and i do not want to spam the sub with posts these guys fullon looking like the hottest new boys band the new kids on the grid look how happy they are love to see it 4 wdc in one picture get yourself a man that looks at you like zak does at lando everyone on that photo looks genuinely happy to be theregood call from f1 to race in miami gardens christian still loves seb were cameras allowed for nonjournalists or was it phonecams only enjoy the show and the race on sunday usa greets from an austrian f1 fan as on every race sunday my friends and i will watch from my place on sunday evening our timezone a whole episode about how lando hates daniel so much he would not even let him stand with the team at the opening party is coming big dad energy from christian and zaklook at the way zak looks at lando and christian looks at seb like the proudest dads out there poor kev at the back lol great pic hope you enjoyed the party the livestreams posted on f1s official youtube channel if anyones interested in checking it out why did they need rush the intros was the music talent on some crazy contract to perform precisely at a certain time kevin peeking from the bg mick seems to gravitate towards seb let us be real everyone was just there to see latifi the fact that you got a glimpse of the goat is the reason it is a great pic if they are all there already its kind of strange not doing the official media on the thursday nice pics what is up with ricciardos shirt does he wear one size bigger i was way too focused on it when watching the opening party last night landos polo fits him just fine it looks like carlos looks very relieved that the sand is outside the track this time kmag podium confirmed look at him scheming plotting dang latifi looks like he has a huge head in this shot i watched it on youtube and there were only a few fans relatively speaking probably less than 1k you can tell the production was trying to show as little of the crowd as possible zhou joining mcclaren confirmed s i scrolled thru you are post history that realistic batboy post is abnormal so what is the over under on the number of drivers who test positive for covid next week i posted a few more pics here is a link the beaming smiles what daniel so happy about pursuing hobbies original res photo well this is odd lol only bloomberg would think that ridiculously expensive entry prices are something worth celebrating the article is actually a very good read bb does quality journalism how did they do it netflix actually a really solid article really great article if you do not want to read it more highlights the differences between how bernie approached f1 vs how liberty approaches managing the sport netflix was a shot in the arm but if there was no f1tv or social media presence the sport really would not be as popular as it is now dts made it more approachable but libertys management has made it consumable love the dig on nascar lmao looking like a nintendo power cover from the 90s ferrari about to add caltrop compartments to their rear end that drawing does not show any difference between old and new airflow it only points out where the change happened am i missing smth smh man i just want carlos to finish the race as someone who is a total f1 noob and new to the sport it blows my mind that that little of a change can be the deciding performance factor of who potentially wins yes tighter fights is all we need hope mercedes solve their issues faster so that there will be a three way fight i hope mercedes upgrades work as well it would be awesome to see 3way battle between all 3 top teams always mildly amusing to me that they are doing over 300kmh whilst seated as if they are in a lounge chair original res photos photo photo 2 photo 3 i know it is been designed safely but man it looks fucking terrifying that the fuel is directly behind the driver like that this is actually a drawing of kimi you can easily tell by the lack of drink in the cockpit one of the best follows on f1 twitter have learned a lot from his posts ill be really disappointed if there is no cocks damn that seating position gives a whole different perspective this explains the bottass all the blood congregates in drivers\\' posteriors it really shows how tightly packed they are in there with all the seating and padding around them and also see the roll over area that the halo and the rollover hoop create what is the fia safety camera used for is there any footage available i mean yeah for safety obviously but in which circumstances for example the seat is lighter than i would have expected probably no padding either people do not realise the amount of core strength required to be sat in this position for 2 hours with the performance of those cars go try and sit in this position yourself for a small insight no pee bags and a driverno arrows point to a driver do not some teams have their drinking system in the nose forgot the steering wheel mercedes logging on to watch this explained again buchan sport strikes again in his running series about 2022 floor concepts i do not get why this post is so unpopular the video tries to explain a working theory which is does rather eloquently b sport is still hypothesizing but as a very fresh exf1 aerodynamicist his musings are a lot more informed and interesting to watch than most youtube channels regarding the technical side of f1 this year good theories this just looks like circuit specific upgrade we will know if they brought any upgrades to mitigate porpoising tomorrow when they have to detail the upgrades for the show and tell at mercedes they are convinced that they have found the keys to the lack of competitiveness of the w13 and are working hard to try to revive the fortunes of the world constructors champion team brackleys team was sure they had a car with extreme aerodynamics that should have given them a one second advantage per lap the facts have shown that this was not the case and on the contrary lewis hamilton and george russell found themselves as the third force with a silver arrow that pays a gap of six to seven tenths per lap from red bull and ferrari for the mercedes technicians the main difficulties derive from the exaggerated frequency of porpoising that brings the nefarious hopping almost all the way into the corners while on the ferrari it runs out much earlier as the top speeds drop while we wait to see what mike elliotts engineers have prepared for the fifth seasonal event there is a weight reduction of about 3 kg we have to observe the front wing of the w13 which was designed for the miami straights almost 2 kilometers long the image of giorgio piola taken in the paddock highlights how the adjustable flap has been redesigned to reduce drag in particular the incidence in the portion that goes from the nose to the support brackets has been reduced while the trailing edge it has been reshaped with clearly visible material removals that make the profile very shaped its around one tenth of a second if i am not mistaking right hopium incoming i said it yesterday but i hope mercedes can challenge at the front this season not because i want them to win another championship but because having three teams compete at the top is better than two if alpine and mclaren or any other team can also get to the top that would be awesome as well but it seems like mercedes is the closest as it stands 3kg equates to about a tenth a lap given the margins of the midfield group that is quite helpful for context a tenth would have seen george move up one in bahrain lewis into at least q2 and george up one again in saudi no change in australia but lewis would have been a fraction behind norris nothing would change in imola thanks to changing conditions and noncompleted laps in red flags obviously this can be negated by other teams losing weight but it will make a difference in isolation nevermind the porpoising hopium for myself 3 kg the whole team slaves away to shave off every last bit of weight meanwhile the guys on the front wing are like \\'our bad we thought we needed a sack of spuds in there\\' but they still have the porpoise which is going to hurt them alot this weekend they have taken the sandbags off boys its happening mercedes 12 incoming wings are actually the same its the adjusters on the end that are smaller haha sandbags 3kg weight reduction is insane considering front wing only weight about 10kg i do not quite believe this cuz some says mercedes was just 1kg over the 798kg minimum weight although they make this 3kg reduction they still need to adding 2kg somewhere else this may change the weight balance of whole car which may give a little bit advantage i guess cannot wait until this somehow makes the car worse finally can get ahead of gasly or can he let us hope they get knocked out in q1 again like in jeddah this is the same wing from aus seems to me that is a decent amount of weight to drop although if the porpoising situation is not improved by this then its not really going to change much new floor too at first i thought you meant they had unloaded aero which would actually probably help with porpoising taking 3kg off the very front end must do a ton to help with understeer but id be worried about even more oversteer out of the corners i was expecting to also see a very heavy zippo in this photo miami has so many slow bumpy corners the porpoising will cripple them this weekend what are they going to light up with a 3kg lighter a lap around this circuit seems fun i do not care what anyone says this track layout has a good mix of nearly everything you want in a track tricky apex turns 5816 straights long enough to pass on heavy braking zones at the end of the straights tight technical sections that may not be good for overtakes but punishes mistakes the only thing it lacks is elevation changes no porpoising this game is literally unplayable smh also that offcenter she will logo on the ferrari halo looks odd i know its because they cannot show alcohol advertising so they removed the logo on the other side but it would look better if they centered the she will logo love the turn complex under the overpass a little up a little down a little wiggle i bet we will see big time gaps there seems ripe for little errors i did not buy f1 2021 because i knew it would be the exact same game as the 2019 and 2020 version i hoped the 22 game would be a brand new game with new physics graphics game engine and hopefully new netcode for multiplayer but this looks like a freaking reshade of 2021 again ffs the circuit looks awesome seems quite long but very well done we have heard the mercedes and honda engines in the game time for ferrari not abusing the kerbs this is not charles is it me or does the marina have real water in the game its like a mix of sepang baku and singapore i mean it is charles it has to be hot right this circuit is perfect for the redbull i expect another 12 you mean dlc from f1 2017 for price of 80 euros got it garbage that area under the bridge looks so clunky and ripe for a big crash love the turn complex under the overpass a little up a little down a little wiggle i bet we will see big time gaps there seems ripe for little errors probably an extremely stupid question on my part but will they actually develop different car models for the vastly differing cars on this year\\'s field instead of just the same generic show car with mildly incorrect liveries each time how hard is it to get new engine sounds i do not understand there are so many engine sound mods on racedepartment for other games made by people and a whole game just keeps the same engine sounds for 23 years i fucking hate codemasters aw damn its just a repainted showcar this livery seems like it would look amazing on an at03 while teams are scraping liveries off alpha tauri is recycling that paint because you know environment oh an art car that would be so cool to see them use it for the race direct link to video here hq possibly a one off livery its going to be another nft by mr gasly brand new factory and windtunnel in 2024 audi will be very happy rather that than them taking over mclaren aston martinaudi stroll admits discussions news aston martinaudi stroll admits discussions lawrence stroll has confirmed that he has spoken with audi which is interested in taking over the f1 business and said he is very happy with the collaboration with mercedes fabiano polimeni 20 hours ago the presentation of financial results during the first quarter of the year coincided with the announcement of aston martins new ceo amedeo felisa replaces tobias moers and together with another former ferrari roberto fedeli head of the technical department since june will have to lead lawrence strolls brand towards the growth and development phase in the electrification era the conference call with investors however served not only to present the q1 results but also to comment on the rumors very solid of an aston martin approached by audi audi in formula 1 with its own team the scenario is that of the german brands entry into formula 1 from 2026 they are working on several solutions where the way in the case of porsche is better defined and looks at the collaboration with red bull the track that led to the acquisition of mclaren by audi seems to have cooled at the same time increased the odds on a possible purchase of the aston martin team along with rumors that also look in the direction of williams racing and others to sauber motorsport stroll confirms rumors lawrence stroll confirmed the discussions he had with audi in a brief statement in response to bank of america explained if we have been approached by audi yes are we very happy with our collaboration with mercedes yes the world of formula 1 is full of these stories the collaboration with mercedesamg is very close under the industrial profile and an audi entry in formula 1 from the aston martin door would be configured with its own team to take over structures and registration as well as benefits of the pact of concord aston stroll has launched an important investment plan called however to produce results that so far have been absolutely disappointing in the commitment of the team in formula 1 strolls declarations have been understated admitting discussions with audi and obviously supporting the technical collaboration with the power unit supplier mercedes could it be the bells of an attractive offer from audi to convince stroll to leave the scene in formula 1 in taking over and saving aston martin in 2020 formula 1 has been identified by the canadian businessman as a key showcase for building a recognized global brand and player in the luxury performance sector i remember a beyond the grid cannot remember who where they made the point that establishing a truly new team is a bastard none of the good folk want to work for you it could last three years and be a disaster rather than facilities 90 of the value of f1 teams is the people so i think audi will be better off paying through the nose for something like sauber sounds like the best option for audi aston martin is based in the uk and build a completely new facility would be great to see a seat open up again honestly the team was performing better under vjm micromanagement is killing this team i rather prefer the full take over omg vettels 5th wdc in an audi as long as it is not mclaren please at least have it be a full on takeover then i cannot stand daddy stroll much less when he might actually win \"have we been approached by audi yes are we very happy with our collaboration with mercedes yes the world of formula 1 is full of these stories\" this is what he actually said you guys want stroll gone so badly you believe every headline bye bye daddy stroll do not forget to take lance or let the door hit you on the way out this is great news the sooner the strolls are out of f1 the better for all this guy is looking for someone who can solve the teams technical problems with him constantly looking over their shoulders total micromanaging piece of shit that would be great we could see a full german team in mick seb or nico if they went full german in the marketing how does this work with the mercedes ties aston martin has how does this work commercially there is bound to be some overlap between their road car markets this would make way more sense than mclaren for one thing mclaren has complex ownership they have sold off or licensed out so many parts of the business that trying to buy all of that back to absorb the brand would be a massive headache given the amount of money being pumped into aston martin both as an f1 team and car manufacturer a lot of the world audi would need to do is already in place combined with a team that is historically pretty damn good at saving a few quid if my understanding is correct what that is doing is basically prevent car from going any lower then it should i think ted discussed this briefly in the notebook its interesting because largely speaking you are better off with packages of upgrades in 2022 because its more efficient use of resourcesunless its something like this which unlocks what the car is really meant to be doing and is actually a very small upgrade if you think of the 2005 mclaren a very small tweak unleashed the car i think where folk are getting confused is the idea that mercs problems are the latter if my understanding is correct what that is doing is basically prevent car from going any lower then it should finally merc can fix its porpoising this is why i love f1 and the precision engineering that comes with it it just looks like a few slots of carbon fiber but the change can either put you near the front or be lapped several times driver61 video that explains this when we first saw porpoising in preseason testing the trivial fixes people were commenting about included this one active suspension bumpersskates etc i believe there were even specific comments from either braun a team principal or aero sme iirc saying that those would not fix the issue it seems like we just had a definitive article like this saying it was actually the rear suspension so it just feels like this is ongoing clickbait to further leverage this topic to drive traffic so my idea of a zero height floor actually kind of was right and could work just not the whole floor obviously ferrari will bring this upgrade this race let us see if this may help last year i had a game with my family where everyone was given 2 drivers at random and points were awarded by track positions gainedlost at first it got very hectic but started getting interesting once everyone started getting engine penalties also it was a rollercoaster of emotions wishing for your favorite driver to start low on the grid to give you lots of possible points but at the same time wanting to have your favorite driver start high up in the grid because you want to see them in the podium would it be possible for you to share the sheets link i have been maintaining a google sheet of my own to classify the race results and the standings just for fun and i am pretty sure i have done a lot of unnecessary work to make it since i am not too good with sheetsexcel would love to take a look at yours that is pretty cool makes it a lot more fun thanks for sharing any chance you share the templates if we wanted to replicate fun fact more people were at the soccer stadium for ocon\\'s visit and there was not even a game on then at the marlins game where max and checo threw out the first pitch pink does suit him a lot so weird to see him so close to home higuain and ocon swap deal here we go poor esteban meeting some shit soccer players while gasly was having diner with jordan i mean i do not think an european have to go to us to visit a football team it like econ ring his manager and said everyone is meeting some celebs hook me up with someone as well lol i assume its a safety thing to slow the cars down before entry but its a shame that it will probably increase the pitstop delta and make a two stop strategy less attractive let me put a tenner on a latifi or mick dnf original res photo please not carlos please not carlos i am going to it looks too tight for your everyday road car much less an f1 car that has the slow speed turning ability of a 200ft long cargo ship i get it could just be the angle of the photo but it looks very tight coulthard is having flashbacks this pit entry with the possibility of a classic florida flash flood thunderstorms mid race someone could easily end their race there and if multiple people are pitting at once it can because proper carnage that reminds me of the le mans pit entry chicane in a way it will test the drivers no doubt to see who can master this tricky chicane we have seen crashes at or in pit entry before id be intrigued to see if we get that here since when is latifi called \"somebody\" no gravel trap so hamilton is safe everyone staring at latifi be like who will cut it the most i do not like these long time loss pitlanes since the speed limit reduction 2 stops have been so difficult so we end up with 1 stop and lots of tyre saving the drivers are lucky that it will be dry slow button on what happens if you cut the track in the pitlane penalty well it has tarmac when you miss the entry of the chicane so where is the problem just because were in america does not mean we suddenly have to stop putting turns on our racetracks latifi is going to make 1 fanbase extremely happy and another extremely upset then it seems cough latifi cough deleted china 2007 is without a doubt in my top 10 f1 moments of all time along with senna crashing prost out at suzuka in 1990 and all the bose headphones that died last year whenever toto did not get his way should be long enough for people to forget about daniel about yeah noice back up to a full 12 team grid aka the peroni ad with f1 car in it this is really bad i am going to the car is the least obvious thing on this this is feeling more of a peroni advert than an aston martin poster to me well it is certainly another poster from the aston martin aramco cognizant peroni f1 team p e r o n i it lacks finesse not enough refined gradation highlights subtle texture peroni bottle is too dull and looks faceted which it is not overly saturated magenta orb behind the car is slightly overpowering does not quite match her lip colour face looks straight out of shutterstock its basically a bit pony i am being harsh i am tired tough titty toenails the car looks strange particularly the sidepod bspec leak by peroni this sucks so who is drinking 0 alcohol beer does this mean vettel has a name ready for the car she reminds me of flo from progressive is that the same nastro azzurro that sponsor valentino rossi during his early years in motog gta vice city focus and have the girl\\'s face as most of the poster have the drink near her lips as if she is drinking it and have the car in the reflection of her glasses since she is zoomed in there will be more of the car and it will not look so stupid and transparent as a slap job marketing ad this is not a race poster this is a beer ad ah yes the real focus of this gp this is goodas a peroni poster bad f1 poster though will it be painted to look like the ocean ocon coming close to nando this week possibly ocon podium incoming allonsy a shame there is so much sponosor names flying around the man has good taste in helmets source quality of the picture is unfortunately not so good but its the only one i could find of the helmet that is what the alpine livery should have been i thought the gp was in miami maimi i cannot believe how crowded his helmet looks sponsors sponsors sponsors if the helmet was green id call it chick hicks i also dislike bwt demanding the drivers to pink it up i miss the distinct fernando look we have come to love love the helmet but are all the helmets this weekend about to look the same d gasly max and now alonso all look pretty similar going with the miami beach look that looks good miami vice colours and palm trees muy original i see they went with the vaporwave theme how original nothing beats maimi if only the alpine looked like this it seems as if everyone is bringing a new helmet design to miami i feel like i need to buy a hawaiian shirt or something just to watch the race great stuff op secondly do you expect any copyright issues going forward you should absolutely expect issues may arise especially if one of f1s broadcasters decides they want to do similar videos or features yep good stuff ta this is awesome ill definitely check out this channel after races you should add text describing what is happening in the race like max approaching backmarkers or leclerc slow pitstop cool job repost wait is that an american football player statue this event was so akward ngl looks like a wwe wrestlemania entrance stage they carry on doing events like this and generating the excitement i bet they will put the crown jewel label onto miami in no time bottas this feels a far too dramatic headline for what brown said in a podcast ricciardo has a contract through till the end of 2023 and they are just waiting until later this year to start negotiations and talks they have got time and hes got time all these rumours swirling because mclaren is testing oward and herta as mandated by f1 for the two rookie testing sessions seem a bit dramatic for the moment tomorrow norris extends hit contract till 28 always good to anticipate early people need to chill results in races they both have finished this year lando 15553 danny146618 he was destroyed in 2021 but is comfortably matching norris this year diffusor damage due to racing incident albeit his fault it was just close racing into a blind corner in the rain and not really indicative of poor performance mclaren in no hurry to sign ricciardo do not commit too early remy ramjiawan thursday 5 may 2022 0757 mclaren boss zak brown says daniel ricciardo is not sure of a place with the wokingbased team after 2023 the smiling australian had a volatile debut season at mclaren but is also in 2022 slower than teammate lando norris ricciardo was brought in for his experience in the top of the field in his time at red bull racing the australian was still able to pick up the occasional victory when max verstappen joined in 2016 he was sometimes able to outpace even the 2021 world champion nevertheless the overall trend surrounding ricciardos arrival at mclaren is currently disappointing the australian still has a contract until 2023 and therefore enough time to prove himself but there are also alternatives for the team from woking alternatives brown states in conversation with formula1com we have one more season together after this year and of course we are already thinking about the long term whether that will be with ricciardo or without the australian brown does not say he does hint however that there are plenty of alternatives ready we will test with pato oward and colton herta he says brown wants to postpone the decision on whether or not to extend the contract with ricciardo its best not to commit to these things too early and were not in a hurry he explains of the eighttime race winners tenure ricciardo feeling better apart from the contract brown sees ricciardo doing better at mclaren this year yes he definitely is his races are going better and he has won something in qualifying as well the 50yearold american says the man who took carlos sainzs spot at mclaren is also a year on hes not quite comfortable in the car yet but his bond with lando is more than good he has also got to know the team very well brown explains after last seasons dip in form brown is therefore pleased that ricciardo has found his way up the ladder of course we are happy that he is back on top himself he concludes why would they hurry there is plenty of time to negotiate indeed since hes signed until the end of the next season can you blame them if ricciardo continues to slump around in the lower midfield while lando challenges for podiums i would not be at all surprised if mclaren buy out his contract and go with a new driver for 2023 when its all said and done i think ricciardo while be viewed as a capable driver that made some bad career decisions and survived off his red bull reputation for a bit too long i have been around here for a few years and i have never seen such hate for danny its like he killed everyone is dogs really not sure where its coming from to be honest daniel is only 32hes got a lot left to give in formula one i am just amazed how far his performances have dipped i guess hes really sensitive to the car if its not working to his liking the results will be averagebelow average what he had at red bull and to a degree at renault is not translating over at mclaren i do not know what people are talking about to be honest he was absolutely off the pace on bahrain but obviously recovering from covid and lack of track action in saudi he qualified next to norris and with only a tenth between them and his race pace was great before his retirement in australia he qualified a few places down on lando but finished the race only half a second behind him in imola again only a few places down in qualifying on lando finished directly behind i am in the sprint then his race was fucked in turn 1 partially his fault but bottas hit him anyway which damaged his car and ruined any fightback but he kept going the rest of the race with a damaged car getting good data for the team hes a little short of norris atm same as carlos is a little short of leclerc perez a little short of max and hamilton a little short of russell but its not like last year where he clearly could not get a handle on the car its logical for mclaren to do that sadly daniel since 2021 has big decline of form losing to lando especially in qualies adaptation problems in 21 thanks to that mclaren was p4 not p3 and only had 23 flashes for person who was in top 5 2020 drivers it is unacceptable i do not see ricciardo staying after 2023 if he keeps struggling that much compared to norris but in f1 a lot can change in that timeframe i sure hope he will improve his race pace oh ricciardo i really hope you can prove the doubters wrong buddy yeah i listened to the podcast and this is clickbait if danny performs well this year and he has been on par with lando every race except the shunt at imola where he was right with lando he will get another deal but of course mclaren wants to see what their young drivers can do every team feels that way should hold on then grab a senior porsche seat to help them get a grip early feels like a good fit with his late braking and all unless something picks up with daniel i can see them getting oward or another one of the indy guys in good hes too much of a wildcard atm needs to pull off a miracle in these next few races before we can even begin thinking of a future for ricc at mclaren huge fan love to see him in his prime again i feel like ricciardo is absolutely no certainty to retain his seat atm his performance would need to lift substantially to justify an extension i would have thought i think danny was just really suited to red bull cars he was known for breaking at the very last second and for his ballsy overtakes i get the feeling that the mclaren is just a different type of car and he is not suited to driving it i bet if you could put him back in a rbr car he would be placing a lot better but the fact that he has a huge salary and is getting beat by lando are already two strikes zak mentions looking to the future we all know that means putting an american driver in the second seat unfortunately you do not look to the future with a guy his age in f1 anymore it is a young man\\'s game now i think he would just retire he has said many times that if he cannot win a wdc then what is the point he has more than enough money he will just land in la and have a bunch of sex i do not really see him doing anything else in f1 frankly the guy is as dumb as a bag of hammers but he looks good so he will be just fine i still do not get the renault move he made if not for the crazy money than what else would be the reason to go to a team whose engine just ruined your last shot at a wdc he is completely lost in that mclaren for sure but who could do better i do not think there is neither a better driver available nor an amazing rookie waiting for that seat maybe they could reach an agreement with alpine and sign piastri and maybe even use renault motors that could be benefitial for both as the mercedes pu is quite weak and alpine could use the data analysis of two more cars but i do not know smart from them id go for someone else surely welp pato o\\'ward should get his seat two mexicans in f1 would be so amazingly cool i love danny ric as much as the next one but his stay at mclaren has been underwhelming racking up this kind of salary to perform at a mediocre level most of the time below his teammate does not look great maybe mclaren value his prpower and technical insights more than we understand but performance wise its hard to justify keeping him for the salary he has deleted he does not belong in f1 anymore i would love to see him replaced by piastri if you win f3 f2 back to back you are good and deserve a shot ric had his shot now that i am used to the 18 inch rims these things look tiny lol i believe that is actually the renault 2020 car the rs20 ot i really liked slovenia when i went there where did you see this as a slovenian i feel its my duty to go see it in person where in slovenia excatly is this holy bargeboards the nose has alos 14 but towards the back of the car you see ocons 31 hmmmmm that is actually tadej pogacar is it just more or does that look very short that actually looks like a real car but it is 2020 not 2021 i think based on the barge boards and the vents right behind the halo which i do not think they had in 2021 fwiw its not last years car or any other years its a show car a fake car with a mix of parts in many cases they are things that were never even for another car and in some extreme cases red bull are known for this the car is a plastic she will i am so happy we got rid of barge boards fucking hideous they look so clunky and boxy now especially with all that greebling saward only wrote that de vries might be a good candidate for a latifi swap he did not write that they were in any contact sees latifi\\'s seat \"huh i wonder who that is for\" whether he ever gets a seat in f1 or not i hope sky hires the guy for more broadcasts he has the insight of a nico in his analysis and a somewhat similar impressive grasp of the english language but seems to connect way better with the grid when doing interviews de vries surprised by williams rumours wonder where they got that from kimberley hoefnagel thursday 28 april 2022 1456 last update 1505 gpfans spoke exclusively with the people involved for this article nyck de vries has not yet had any contact with the williams team about a possible switch to formula 1 he told gpfans the driver from sneek is not aware of the rumours and emphasises that he will continue to focus on his formula e campaign earlier this week there were rumours in the british media that the williams team would be interested in bringing nyck de vries in the british team would like to continue without nicholas latifi in 2023 and is therefore looking for his replacement according to sky sports the team has its sights set on alpine reserve driver oscar piastri however joe saward a renowned formula one journalist said that williams doubts that this is the right move the team would rather work on its own future by putting someone in that seat who is not linked to another team de vries was put forward as the best candidate de vries responds to rumours de vries himself however has no idea where this rumour came from these rumours are new to me the 27yearold told gpfans in an exclusive interview i have no idea where you read them the rumours ed or where you came across them but then i am very curious where they got that from the mercedes driver stressed because honestly i have no idea asked if de vries would consider a move to williams he replied of course formula 1 is a dream that is a dream for every young driver but otherwise i think it is still quite early in the season we are only at the sixth race in our championship so yes let us first make sure we get a few points here again said the dutchman translated with wwwdeeplcomtranslator free version de vries is one of those guys who went under radar because guys like mick get f1 seat thanks to their name and guys like mazepin got their seat by just money mazepin won same amount races as mick in f2 season but he had the 5th best team not prema tsunoda won 3 awards in f2 that season for a reason coming to singapore for the first time this year very excited what are the major tourist attractions that would be good to do during the daylate afternoon before the f1 sessions is there a lot of food options that will be open late at night after the f1 sessions what is the best transport from i do not know the area but from geylang road near \\'eminent frog porridge\\' to the track is it easiest to get from the airport to the city via rail and is google maps reliable for public transport sorry for all the questions haha nice to see a fellow sinkie f1 fan here my favourite place to go in sg is boon tong kee they have many locations but i cannot resist their steamed chicken and rice crispy bean curd also frog leg porridge at 4 am tastes good too finallysingapore fans how nice of you to do this thank you i am a singaporean myself haha and looking to attend this year gp after following f1 religiously since 2019 understand that the early bird tickets were sold out so looking to get one closer to the date having said that which areazoneticket will give me the most value and how many days would you suggest i should attend any other tips are appreciated where can i buy one of those half cooked egg makers where you just pour boiling water it nice work fellow sg lad is there any seb singapore merch being sold near the track i think i saw a few images of them sold in local shops as he is the lion of singapore i have been to singapore many many times and am looking forward to the gp this year as far as the gp goes what is the premier location to view the race from the track and what is the best post race venue any recommendations for areas to stay at i will be at the bay grandstand and a bit lost at the moment on where to stay lodgings wise i mean i got a ticket to the pit grandstand taking an extended vacation from work this year as i am working far too much and finishing it with the race splurging on accommodations and the tickets but i love street food fancy parties are not my thing any highlights for hawker centres near the track area i love walking through cities best way to get a feel for the place so if it is a few kilometres away that is all good additionally are the concerts an all day or night thing cannot wait to experience this thanks so much for doing this do you know in general where drivers come in to the track so we have the opportunity for a picture or autograph right now my wife and i have tickets for turn 1 which gets us access to all four zones i believe we are also staying for a week after the race anything you recommend we go do on weekdays where there are less crowds possibly thanks booked my flight just a few days ago coming from the us houston texas and have a few general questions in markets and food centres are transactions mostly cashless or do you always need to carry a good amount of cash what is the scene like around the circuit both before and after the events each evening packed bars and convenience shops difficult to get around etc does it take long to get inout of the track area like how much time should you budget for ticket scanning finding seats food and drink lines etc i have been told i must try chili crab as such any recommendations for chili crab locales we were hoping to go to the gp as we are vacationing in bali at that time but a 3 hour flight is just a bit too far for a one day trip we will be sure to plan it better next year have fun you all i depart in the morning to go to miami for my first grand prix have tickets in the turn 1 grandstands does anyone have any advice really excited for the gp most of the track looks like it should be fun from a racing standpoint and from a viewers standpoint i still hate the overly tacky couple of bits but depending on how the race is directed i hope i will not have to see the stupid marina and beach more than once i do not understand the rampant hate for this gp before its even happened once so many f1 fans are just obnoxiously stuck in the past all this hype around miami feels like f1 is trying to replace monaco does anyone know if redbull brought further upgrades to miami or are they running their imola update package this feels like the ultimate apples to oranges comparison where there is no correct answer but here goes what is the best part of any track to be a viewer at in other words if you could have a front row seat to any place on the f1 calendar where are you sitting is it where the track is is it how good the racing is at that specific part is it how good a look you get at the action us people going to montreal what is your strategy for getting tested before returning to the us our hotel is kind of boutiqueey so its not offering inhotel testing they sent me to this service biron that is expensive but does testing i am wondering if there is anything else i am missing thanks i am watching the classic usa 1982 f1 race in las vegas on sky f1 what a terrible looking track i did not realise it genuinely was in the car park of caesar\\'s palace looks like it was throw together in a few days i am genuinely beyond excited for the miami gp this is hyped up a lot by the videos and f1\\'s investment looks very exciting has any grand prix been hyped as much as miami this year singapore 2008 might be that one as it was the first ever night race in f1 but i do not think any other race matched the hype does anyone know of any f1 related things to see outside of the circuit itself i know that there is a red bull show car in front of one of the hotels and there is a williams pop up somewhere but other than that i am not sure of anything happening around the city austin was great for a few years when it came to f1 stuff to see around town i am in the uk where the f1 tv app does not work for live streaming without a vpn but does anyone know if you can watch recent races the day after or week after i know it offers historic races but i just want to know how recent of a race you can watch what happened to that show and tell thing they were introducing this year i assume i have just completely missed it but i thought it would be a bigger deal when i first heard about it iv only just got back into f1 but i feel skyf1 are very pushy in terms of getting in the drivers faces etc and they had an interview with christian on the pit wall mid race how do you add the f1teams to your reddit name how are race distances determined as far as i know they have to be at least 300km i have come to learn that the upcoming miami gp will be around 308km so why is it this and why not one lap less or one lap more thanks question for some of you grand prix veterans the miami grand prix will be the first for my friend and i we have seats at turn 18 and i could not be more excited to actually watch in person just wondering what is the best way to watch have the f1tv international broadcast playing in headphones for commentary is there much of a delay or will the screensproduction there be good enough to follow what is happening any other tips and tricks are super appreciated are ticket prices normally this high for an f1 race i was so excited when they announced the gp in miami and was planning on going it would be my first gp but prices are soo high i am discouraged to purchase a ticket at the current prices i am looking every 30 min for ticket price changes does anyone know a good place to purchase tickets or even have an extra one honestly any advice is appreciated thanks overunder on how many times we see brady and jordan on race day i am genuinely excited not just because it is in the states but i like seeing new tracks with that said was there ever any talk about holding it at night i mean i understand the issue with timing and having a race at 010300 in europe but racing under the lights at this track would be amazing anyone know of watch parties in nyc not usually my thing but miami seems like a good one to watch with a crew i want to learn more about the science behind the cars does anyone have good resources i am very knowledgeable about physics so i will take any references idc if its meant for a child or a phd i have an extra room at the eden roc for miami the hotels are now going for 1200 usd a night i paid 300 and would be willing to transfer to someone for the 300 a night rate best place to offer this up i am currently awaiting my requests to join some facebook groups for miami how was ferrari allowed to test a new floor during the pirelli tyre tests 40 of rain on sunday in miami why are you guys so hard to please anyone else surprised that nascar is having their darlington race at the same time as the miami gp i do not personally like nascar myself but i am wondering which series decided on that timeslot first and if the other decided to compete directly by design or if its just an unfortunate coincidence wondering what the fans of both series think of this i do love f1 for making one of the few races on the calendar that i could have a drink during since its not on at 8am happen on mothers day so i get to miss it on the road i do not watch much sports center and i am not in florida but disappointed in the lack of hype for this race in the general media seems like there was a lot of talk after texas last year not sure what i am expecting but it seems to be very quiet does anyone know anything about the relationship in the garage at alfa i feel like i have heard relatively little about the team despite decent performances from bottas and zhou just saw they are 4th in constructors i have heard rumours about a ricciardogasly swap does this rumour have any merit or is it just something to gain attention it is so annoying how hard they are pushing the gp sending george to a heat game leclerc checo and max to a marlins game pierre meeting jordan and lewis with tom brady no fernando at the miami opening not sure why f1 is going with the so bad its good approach for this race any idea has there ever been an f race where they just threw up a race track and no one really knew what was going to happen on it like this from my understanding miami has a lot of long straights and red bull has been the fastest on the straights therefore max is the favorite this weekend is this thinking correct anyone order miami merch from mclaren just curious if anyone has had their order ship yet i ordered on launch day and only got an order email nothing about shipping yet was hoping to get it before the race sunday what is the best site for buying gp tickets second hand ill be in houston during the usgp on oct 23 i found some tickets on seatgeek is that any good is miami open to general trackrace activities beyond f1 like cota or is this strictly an f1 venue when do you think the seasons first race without a safety car will be i feel like the drs will be overpowered here the one in the finish straigh line looks fine but the other 2 seems to long can someone explain the water meme that is been going around before the miami gp anyone going to baku recommendation on hotels hey guys i see you pop up on my frontpage from tiem to time so i think of you guys once in awhile well today a live streamer his name is jake was invited by the mclaren racing team so hes in the cars and in the pits any charlotte nc fans in here so what will be the fast lap time in practice will there be any safety cars in the race i say yes i need to get this off my chest other than cota the f1 season should not recur in the usa not las vegas or miami it feels like an money making machine now why would they give the usa out of all countries three races it is beginning to feel like a joke at this point i am actually looking forward to hearing some peoples opinion but this is driving me crazy the tracks they create now seem so familiar it is so annoying at least take drs out now if the cars can race closer and for the love of god design a track that is not walled off make it safer and more accessible to other sports adopt new tracks just do not create these long straights where that is the only way to overtake it is getting annoying at this point 22 races is too much drivers know they can afford to dnf out of 12 races and still win the championship make it less make every rave worth more okay i am done hes a shit person a bad driver and his countrys government is fucking up but nikitas 2022 helmet was nice as hell is there any elevation change around the miami track or is it all flat i am not super privy on how the point system has worked over the years but has a championship or maybe even a position in the standings been decided by a fastest lap if not is it possible with current system ok so we know that track time is limited in f1 cars the only times they can practice is during fp1 etc but what is dripping them from getting in an f2 car and taking it out to get a feel for the track does anyone know anything about the relationship in the garage at alfa i feel like i have heard relatively little about the team despite decent performances from bottas and zhou just saw they are 4th in constructors english version for the first time a formula 1 race weekend will take place in miami the route in the sunshine state is therefore completely unknown the drivers could only test it using the simulator the fans are all the more excited about the performance of the individual camps and which updates can be expected after the debacle in imola special focus is on mercedes and lewis hamilton for whom the new terrain in florida could also be an opportunity opponent red bull on the other hand is on top after the double victory in the autodromo enzo e dino ferrari world champion max verstappen won ahead of teammate sergio perez and at the same time caused disillusionment at the scuderia which could not live up to its expectations at the ferrari home game world championship leader charles leclerc finished sixth carlos sainz retired nevertheless the outcome of the coming race weekend not least because of the unfamiliar track is completely open said street circuit the miami international autodrome which runs around the hard rock stadium of the miami dolphins has many challenging corners and a 128 km long straight ready in which top speeds of up to 320 kmh can be reached three drs zones also provide a spectacle the pay tv station broadcasts the race i am just glad mazepin is not racing this track feel bad for latifi already though']"

       "'translated by deepl the fia is going to enforce more strictly the rule that drivers are not allowed to wear jewelry and wear their own nonfireproof clothing indeed it will become part of the technical inspection of the car it was before the australian grand prix that the driver notes prepared by the race director highlighted some already existing rules drivers were not allowed to wear jewelry nor were they allowed to wear their own clothing that was not homologated by the fia lewis hamilton among others took umbrage and indicated that he would in fact be wearing more while mercedes team principal toto wolff was surprised by the new race directors focus points is this the battle they want to take on hamilton now well if this is the worst were not complaining teams now actually risk a penalty that mention of rules that have been in place for a long time had to be read as a warning at the time as it now appears now in fact the fia is going a step further before the start of each weekend the teams have to sign a document declaring that the car complies with the technical regulations now however two additional passages have been included on that form the teams have to declare that the drivers do not wear any jewelry and therefore do not wear their own clothing racingnews365 has seen the document with these new passages these two aspects are now part of the technical inspection of the cars which means that if they are not met the teams registration must be considered illegal normally this will result in an exclusion from the race but in practice it is possible that a fine or a grid penalty will be imposed toto wolff already reacted to the shifting of the rules in the presence of racingnews365 and has now expressed a more nuanced opinion we have to remember why the fia is doing this namely to prevent injuries caused by jewelry nobody is waiting for a freak accident in which that plays a part so the fia has to draw a line somewhere is this a key issue i do not think so but i understand where its coming from \"so what is the dress code\" \"business racing\" inspired by the colour of flag that he will see more of this season the checkered sleeves are a homage to the type of flag he used to see ahead of others in the past seasons aaaaaaaaaaand as always he looks like a pretentious knob this is half the reason i do not like the guy hes always got to try and make a statement the sleeve reminded me of hp sponsored williams is \"his blue outfit\" a thing bruh how is this man not sweating buckets hamilton switching to corvette racing in imsa confirmed zhous shorts are stylish instagram story of both of them i think max is wearing his gf\\'s glasses 6 drivers 3 cars the red bull academy has too many drivers not enough seats jesus look at the williams\\' top speed if only they could figure the rest out williams the best or nothing do not forget to peg bottas as your monaco winner in fantasy note these are broad categories thus not every corner type is accounted for mclaren for example excel in mediumhigh speed corners and mediumlow however this is not included to make it more simple very surprising that mercedes showed up so well in medium and high speed corners as well as on the straights it would seem that porpoising would prove the most disruptive there these look correct haas does its best on medium speed corner what track is best for that direct link to video here hq that t1 camera crane must be higher than any of the guests in miami this weekend volume up the only thing i am not looking forward to this weekend is baking in the sun wonder what the track surface will be like original resolution images from tweet image 1 image 2 image 3 is that a miamispecific livery eh that livery is way too busy for me so much going on its almost like camouflage slightly unrelated but the bh jordan had a pretty good color scheme did not it that paint looks heavy lol that paint looks heavy lol i love the air intake it is perfect looks a battery maybe a bit out of place but it is great i love the duracell design until the brakes explode hope they fixed that issue original res photo i suspect they need to reduce drag as the car is designed to gain most of its downforce trough the floor less drag could also result in less porpoising as we see drs also results in less porpoising the downside is that they lose downforce in general so if they cannot fully utilize their floor they car is just flawed beyond repair the best or nothing are all of the merc changes marginal incremental this far in 2022 yup that is it that is the key let us fucking go i guess this is a good time for ben to see how things are being run over in america first meeting roger penske to discuss indycar and now meeting jim for nascar saturday race 1 230p et espnewsespn3 sunday race 2 1035a et espn2 more info about all this here nice this is big news for them how long till we get a female f1 driver motogp satellite teams do not buy chassis moto2moto3 teams do howevever they buy entire bikes with motors gearbox and all from factories it is close enough to a spec series to call it one and being a spec series is not negative the actual racing in indy is fantastic as a massive indycar fan it is essentially a spec series indycar is a spec series though k sir this is a wendys much like fe it is a mostly spec series i suppose this post was meant to be posted in rindycar indycar is between being a \\'spec series\\' and an \\'open development\\' series being in the middle bewteen both approaches allows them to attract new teams as there is development on the table while keeping the costs reasonable its a similar approach to what formula e has been chasing lately the \\'spec series\\' part of the equation allows indycar to have close racing despite being in a meyer shank car or in a dayle coyne car you still have the chance to fighg for pole positions and race wins that is something which does not happen on series with \\'open development\\' having free development on shocks and dampers does not make indycar a series focused on \\'open development\\' it is a very important part of the car but it is not the whole car letting indycar teams fully develop the chassis and have special partnerships with engine manufacturers would only skyrocket the operational costs of indycar for all intents and purposes indycar is still considered as a \\'spec series\\' because of the same chassis gearbox body which is ultimately what the spectator and average fan will look for the racing is still pretty much what you would find on a \\'spec series\\' like formula e or formula 2 indycar is in the middle of the road and that way of operating has been beneficial to them i have been getting into the ferrari challenge series it is a super spec series the cars are 100 identical and yet there are still like 10 static adjustments you can make and 6 realtime adjustments spec means that the cars are mostly identical as opposed to open or box designs indy falls closest to the spec category cannot imagine that being too comfortable in the miami heat when you have to meet with the queen at 2 but going skiing at 3 straight outta mortal kombat mans never hot is not it like blistering hot in miami right now this is one of the first lewis fits that i am genuinely confused by blueis hamilton i love this one usually cannot stand them awesome fact he is not sweating might be more impressive than his driving records when airline loses your luggage its officially rawe ceek what anime is this from i know i do not understand fashion but man commonwind breaker under dress cloths looks like a jester drowning in drip get that guy an oxygen tank runexpectedsimontemplar looks like he would fight jackie chans or donnie yens character halfway through their respective movie could not attend the meet gala so he brought the met to miami why is he wearing the runescape agility icon around his neck mortal kombat vibe he looks like a bond villain drip king at it again man could not go to the met gala so he makes his own show i love lewis style but this really seems like it should have been a one or the other type deal the blue suit is sick the jacket is sick they look bizarre layered that is sir lewis to you tracksuit is lv sunglasses are offwhite someone please id the vest and pants i wish i had as much confidence and money i mean no hate or disrespect but can people explain to me why this is considered to be fashionable or is it just a you get it or do not kind of thing predicting his race being blue flagged high fashion is dumb change my mind my man\\'s got swag prince is turning over in his grave this one is a miss too bad the last few ones were drip too cocky for a second driver of a midfield team these guys in general must be pretty acclimated to higher heat humidity i am sweating just looking at him does anyone know if hes still featuring black designers met gala was earlier this week lewis lol omg the weekend has begun do you think he has another layer on under the jacket to really seal in his drip a lot of people fail to realize hot hot the drivers get in the cars wearing this is nothing i swear hes intentially taking the piss now that is some actual king shit alright this ones actually pretty sick that is gifting him about 20lbs that is the same cloth as blue flags my boy like to train agility i usually am amused at his outfits but this one is just really bad ahahahah mans won the fit battle this week this shits just goofy do we have a sub just for lewis drips i am all in for it hahaha not climatefriendly manufacturing new clothes every day the man should focus on his car as much as he does his clothes perhaps then he could match russell looks like a dork the court jester has arrived is it a minute behind the frontrunners really dig it bar the strap how much is it a million wonder if it bounces up and down on your wrist if you move your arm i love the colors but watch prices are a bit too much for me if they did the watch face in the petronas blue it would have been like the tiffany nautilus quality of the images are pretty poor but i am very glad to see the introduction of the duracell colours blue and copper is a hot combo how long until the williams mechanics strip that paint off to save weight nice idea original res photos photo photo 2 that is a very cool paint job it immediately invokes batteries well done to the designer man the picture in the replies is great looks fantastic those cheap bastards using a combination of left and right corners to design their track glad they did not replicate the tyreshredder roundabout where is the top view hanoi was an absolutely brutal track in f1 2020 could not stand it miami thankfully looks to have better flow wait so hanoi is not real i have been hating a fake track for years so nice catch when i watched the miami f1 2022 gameplay i was genuinely confused for a moment thinking it was was vietnam lol valtteri\\'s social media shenanigans do not get enough appreciation but dudes more active than almost any other driver on the grid when it comes to random wittyenjoyable content it is incredible you can see the instagram video of this here valtteri is clearly having fun xd he really is living his best life these days is not he good for him in all fairness to the pose he is about the size of one of their cheerleaders so is there a sports team in and around the miami area that an f1 driver has not been to see in the past 4 days vb always looks like one of the biggest drivers but those dudes make him look tiny no tua in sight espn later today f1 driver also hates tua brazzers bottas a fin with the fins laces out this has way too much nsfw meme potential and you know exactly what i am talking about man being on mercedes really suppressed valterri\\'s public character alfa seems fun leaving that porpoising tractor has been the best decision ever for bottas he looks joyful laces out laces out need a picture of valtteri with christian wilkins leaving that porpoising tractor has been the best decision ever for bottas he looks joyful he really loves that alpha shirt lol these f1 guys are so gosh darn cuddly looks like the intro of a porn movie xd just some guys being dudes lol f1 drivers are tiny well at least its not weird no no no i love how it is about racing fun so tired of people on social media pushing their personal agendas hamburg may 5 reuters an agreement for volkswagens vowgpde premium brand audi to join formula one by investing in british luxury sports carmaker mclaren is becoming increasingly unlikely a person familiar with the project told reuters on thursday the price expectations are too far apart the person said adding that while the project had not yet failed its prospects are now close to zero meanwhile talks with swissbased sauber which runs the ferraripowered alfa romeo team and williams are continuing the person said both audi and volkswagen declined to comment a tale as old as time always has been i see that mclaren is doing everything to be customer and have almost 0 chance for title fight is this a sabotage or something i really hope they buy williams they could use a helping hand more detail on new wing changes from scarbs more analysis on new fw by scarbs these just some regular downforce adaptations to a track rather then a true differentiator of airflow or something radical are these the radical changes mercedes is going to bring to become p1 again they cannot change the nose without a new crash test right so the 3 kg is all in the wingswingtips i honestly do not see 3 kg there but whatev is this the only update they brought you can polish a turd but at the end of the day it is still a piece of shit old looks better futurrrrreee face lift mario party mini game its florida there is always a chance for rain its what happens when you build your state on a swamp that pretty normal for this time of year this is actually good bit hot weather for miami this is just showing there is the chance for a quick 30min1hr pop us shower very heavy rain chance but it is usually quick its a peninsula it rains frequently i lived there for a few years and its super common for a single cloud to roll through and drop an inch or two of rain in the span of 30 minutes then go back to sunny weather apps does not tell us a lot they are all based of a computer model with no human input just watch the tv meteorologist or check nws miami on the morning of race source i am a meteorologist when i lived in god\\'s waiting room it seemed to rain everyday in the morning and afternoon for a 20 minute shower 39 chance of getting 7 one hundredths of an inch rain in the forecast we might get some real water in the marina surprised nobody has made a joke about the fake marina yet yesmaybemeh 40 chance of rain with a high of 90f lmao event goers are about to know what it feels like to lose 10lb in an afternoon florida weather it could rain real hard for a couple of minutes or it could do that nearby and completely miss you it is pretty random the lights make it look cool i like this one it is different than the traditional blue and pink theme it is clean big weekend for you yuki and need to lift rooting for another great race as a general rule see full rules a standalone discussion post

you for your cooperation and enjoy the discussion i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorformula1 if you have any questions or concerns the race f1 podcast they do have some very outlandish opinions sometimes but they have a good crew of former f1 race car designers and people that were involved with f1 for years i enjoy it missed apex is the way matt trumpets nyc guy in particular is a knowledgeable yet very understandable f1 pundit i do not know if its the best but shiftf1 have a primer episode to get you informed its episode 178 missed apex gets my vote also i would just skip to season 4 of d2s and watch it its interesting to see where the teams finished and where they are at currently f1 nation official f1 race preview and reviews especially the race reviews got a lot better this year with direct interviews from the paddock with drivers and other team personnel missed apex and f1 beyond the grid any time joe saward is on missed apex is what you should listen to i like scuderia f1 podcast missed apex is my favorite the panel is great and occasionally hilarious shiftf1 podcast it is a longterm us podcast but very accessible they have a preseason primer episode to get you up to speed i quite enjoy missed apex they can be biased towards lewis especially end of 2021 at times but i enjoy the structure of their podcast and they are usually the first to get a show out after the race i also like the ringer f1 show wtf1 just watch donut medias video on youtube on f1 its really good and wtf1 has good information for beginners too glad to have you in this community and i hope you start loving the sport we all fell in love with here 3 you definitely need to binge watch dts s4 from last season beforeas you fly down there also like other have said episode 178 from shiftf1 is all you will need to listen to id recommend back of the grid if you are a brit not a podcast but chain bear on youtube and b sport also on youtube have some great explanation vids on aerodynamics track regulations tyres porpoising that type of stuff ask in daily thread contrast and compair zak to some of the other ceos and damn is he an amazing personality in the sport god i wish that were me also did not f1 ban plane flybys this season i was super bummed when they announced it there are pilots and then there are the blue angels who are absolutely insane wonder if daniel or lando would have wanted to go but zak was like \"drivers cannot go too risky oh by the way i am available\" thhe blue angels is the only thing i have seen in person that rivals f1indycar at speed truly deathdefying amazingly blue angels shows and top gun movies are net positives for the us department of defense that is actually your tax dollars working for you the recruitment benefit outweighs the expense also the blue angels are the most bad ass flying formation in the world but there is a reason the navy will not allow the airforces f22 to fly at naval airshows it is the most stunning and maneuverable airplane that will ever be built by humankind zak definitely seems to be living his best life these days also seems like hes been dropping weight lately no i feel the need man is living life would be really cool to be a multi millionaire deleted original res photo there are many posts showing this particular car its the renault rs20 from the 2020 season not the a521 its got both drivers numbers on too no comment after 2 hours how are you planning on organising this gathering lol flea market display with gucci prices 450 for a tshirt haas offering their caps for 30 is the only reasonable thing i remember at the hungary gp when i was 10 i begged my parents to get me a lewis hamilton mclaren cap they told me its too expensive but they got me one it was 20 buying the haas cap cannot afford to be a better fan than that is that 130 for the purple mercedes hat or is there something below it that cannot be right til my budget is \"haas\" even if i had it i would not spend that kind of money on a that mclaren racing f1 new era 940 2022 special edition fade miami hat is 42 on amazon fyi lol slap that tiny f1 logo 110 gtfo i am good lol haas first year cap for 40 of new big team caps yes please that is a big premium on the merch gene gaining some fans statistically speaking how often is a sucker born wow really judging my past self for scoffing at 20 cocktail drinks at cota in 20162019 range that even included the nice glass it came in this weekend is going to be all sorts of level of stupid and throwing huge amounts of money away it will drive people crazy there is always someone stupid enough to buy those prices make me think this is a tent outside of the track somewhere trying to scalp people i do not think these are actual f1 shop prices there is a sucker born every minute 30 bucks haas cap let us gooooo f1flation 80 for a year old cap seems about right eff that 450 for a 6 button tshirt hell no i have dropped some serious coin at texas gp before but i went home with a lot of stuff this is bs looks like the same prices as austin last year i got my cheapass 40 austin grand prix hat and loved ituntil my dog ate it if i had spent 130 i might have wished the hat ate the dog since he would be cheaper to replace there is a huge markup on this stuff you can buy the same shit on their websites for much less probably the venue taking their cut here is this possibly a stand that is outside the track or is this an official stand pretty similar to cota last year looking like i would be rooting for haas haas for the people this is usd jesus that is ridiculous prices are probably going to be outrageous at the montreal grand prix you should look into americas cup merchandise this garbage in miami is targeted at millionaires pfft i pity americas cup merch is targeted at megamillionaires for a half a second i almost considered getting a 230 prada americas cup tshirt after a friendgirl said yeah but i am pretty sure that is the least expensive prada product ever offered for sale you might want to buy a few edit i am broker than shit i am just really into sailing everyone that reads this post should look into the ac if you did not know 95 of ac fans are f1 fans but only like 1 of f1 fans are ac fans ac and f1 are very similar they are all about rules design engineering and fluid dynamics but the ac has both aerodynamics and hydrodynamics if you like f1 you will like the americas cup its priced similarly to other prestige events like the masters americas cup etc peter millar is just a scam though nothing could make me buy their sportswear all of this shit is way cheaper online 80 for a hat 110 for a shirt ok i scared to even convert dollars to my currency it is all putin\\'s fault first time at a gp they are always insanely expensive went to austin in 2018 and 2019 and the hats were 60 shirts and jackets were 80120 that was 34 years ago add inflation and popularity and you have todays prices peter millar is not cheap but a 14 zip pullover is not 450 it is 150 tops are these prices standard for buying at the event location i was planning to buy merch at the canadian gp but it looks like i can only afford haas polo better come with a hooker f1 is for the rich those prices are a joke lol this is what happens when americans buy the sport smh fans are counted as revenue streams only f1 and miami two things that are not cheap honestly these prices are pretty close to normal nfl merch in miami at a game if you worry about prices miami is not for you i just do not understand the appeal it all looks like tat to me my wallet is pleased what the actual fuck and prices will only go up through the weekend bro heading down there now clearly will not be buying any merch and am going to eat a large breakfast and lunch just buy them on aliexpress few bucks ridiculous basic shirts with a logo on it not even cool designs or whatever wtf that cannot be real bwoah merc white cap is free right right yet another reason to support haas and gunthers go fund me for a new boat teams overcoming budget cap with overpriced merch prices s that is just sad driving people away from representing their brand when i was in imola this year the ferrari baseball caps were 60 and mercedes 40 and i thought that was outrageous lol does anyone buy these at these prices beer goggle pricing surely they would make more money in the long run by lowering the price this is nonsense modern day pricing is usually based on demandsupply rather than a fixed margin over cost that is why so many mega companies grow in value so much because they keep reducing their costs keep increasing their margins and keep increasing their prices while a cap might be 30 on the website they know they if you do not have it and you want to flaunt your support for a team you are going to get it even at a premium hence the inflated costs for things that are relatively less expensive online that is insane i know merch prices do not reflect all prices but man i feel at this rate i will never be able to afford to go a f1 race in the us between travel and price of tickets for more than 1 person it just is not possible unless i am looking in the wrong place i remeber going to us gp cota and hats being like 45 dollars and that was 2016 inflation has not gone up that much 110 dollars for a tshirt kind of pricey f1 how much is the program like 90 dollars not abnormal for races in north america i went to montreal in 2010 and prices were insane even then 70 for a hat 110 for a shirt and 200 for a jacket lmao what fanatics has this all where is that famous budget cap that white polo is legitimately more than a third of my monthly rent definitely would cop that haas hat i am so embarrassed for this whole event so far i see supply and demand is in full effect regarding the haas hat always knew supporting haas would pay me back somehow haha wait until this guy finds out how much pimento cheese sandwiches are at the masters lol miami gp is f1 attempting a total cash grab from the american elite and i get it f1 cars are expensive bummer middleclass fans are getting gouged for souvenirs cheaper than in brazil gp at least well that is gross i love f1 but i feel like attending a race in person or buying the merch is targeted for the uber wealthy damn ill take that haas hat for 30 are those online anywhere i remember liberty media saying they wanted to treat each race like the way the nfl does with the super bowl these prices would back that claim christ they cannot be serious250 for a polo i know inflation is bad but dam not that bad why did they do my haas like that the crack mentality continues right down the food chain haas being real ones i would take a haas hat what the fuck i would buy the haas hat do they not sell pirelli caps at the race what does the 450 shirt do i mean i have two kidneys so i am kind of glad everything is expensive now i do not have to worry about spending any money while at the event i guess if you can afford 2k ticket you can spend 450 on a fking polo god damn the team hats seem to be about the same prices they were at cota in october i have never seen generic f1 merch so overpriced though everyday indycar becomes more and more appealing to me i mean apart from the polos have you been to a concert recently inflation i own zero merch because of their bs prices bro those haas prices be bangin haas with the closest to a reasonable hat price sorry but 450 for that whoa i remember going to silverstone 2019 and it costing 80 for any teams tshirt absolute joke i ended up getting a senna hoodie for 30 instead because if it do not let them rip you off jesus christ meanwhile it looks like a flea market in a third world country i always found it interesting that the seminole indian tribe now completely owns hard rock international this makes miami rb\\'s fifth home race on the calendar looks like the hump at the chicane took max off guard that long straight is just a showcase of the cars straightline speed considering there is no way to set yourself coming out of that chicane professor max his ease at the wheel almost makes you think he does this kind of thing for a living i enjoyed the commentary on it as well hope those two kerbs are not so big in real life or his underbody might be in for a world of pain looks cool very long straight i assume he is in assetto corsa running laps i cannot really tell what sim he is in but i know ac has a mod with the track interesting in the other sim laps videos that rb posts i mentioned how he has a little twerk of his leg whenever he goes full throttle i actually found a video from a mexican pr thing with albon where you could see both drivers legs max did it as well alex did not but in this video no twerk or maybe its the camera angle right between his legs is that the actual red bull sim that chicane is like a cannon comparison between the new rear wing and the old one via duchessa dear lord even more colors popping on that merc car i think it is the same front wing but with a different adjustment they should replace the petronas accent colors with these new color patterns weird livery seeing magnussen do well is such a great story so incredibly happy for him hopefully mick can bring his performance at least on par with k mags it certainly does schumacher is in a car that can score points and hes failed to deliver so far david coulthard mick schumachers future depends on magnussen duel if mick schumacher wants a future in formula 1 he must not look old against kevin magnussen the dane is a surprise for david coulthard author norman fischer coauthor erwin jaeggi 05052022 1725 david coulthard mick schumachers future depends on magnussen duel mick schumachers future in formula one depends heavily on how he fares against his haas teammate kevin magnussen says former driver david coulthard schumacher was seen as a rising star after his convincing performances against nikita masepin in his first year but has stagnated somewhat this season for so far schumacher has been pretty much disenchanted by magnussen the dane made his formula 1 comeback at short notice after a year out and has scored points in three out of four races so far magnussen has already scored 15 points while schumacher along with nicholas latifi is one of only two regular drivers without points micks future depends in many ways on the comparison with kevin coulthard told the dutch edition of motorsportcom at an iwc schaffhausen charity event at miami beach golf club when you get into formula one you are given a rookie year but then you have to deliver the scot said people do not wait for you to be quick you have to be mick beats magnussen only with hard work so far the germans career has actually gone to plan schumacher was champion in formula 3 and formula 2 and according to coulthard also had a very good first season in which he established himself the unknown however was the comparison with teammate nikita masepin schumacher was clearly in control of the latter though the haas was too slow to compete with other cars but with the arrival of magnussen and the better performance of haas there is now a comparison and in that schumacher is currently still inferior in kevin he now has someone he can only beat with hard work says coulthard preferring to highlight the danes performance rather than belittle that of his predecessor masepin the fact that hes consistently getting the haas into the points shows that it was the right decision to bring him back coulthard magnussen drives liberated but the fact that he currently has such a grip on schumacher also surprises the former vice world champion he explains it in such a way that magnussen had actually already finished with formula 1 and is now getting another unexpected second chance in which he has nothing to lose it seems he is driving liberated he says in his first career with mclaren and haas there was always some anger in his style now however magnussen is simply driving consistently well and is 31 up against schumacher in both qualifying and race duels go to overview mick has had it quite easy against masepin so far but now he has realised that he has a fast teammate in kevin and that has pushed mick he has to step up now said coulthard i think its a fascinating battle it will be interesting to see how haas will develop no very cool thanks how do you find out about the pop ups the race is lewis outmatched by guanyu a sith drip lord boy got drip cannot deny what lot is that sneakerheads yes mate my fashion finally lewis has real competition this year looks pretty normal other than the yarn on the shoes gaahdamnnn boy lookin flyy he looks like a aston martin fan prada drip with the dunks is the left leg of his trousers cable tied to his shoe zhougattit my dude has lh

backpack kind of ruins the look he looks like the doctor from idiocracy getting his win this weekend fellas cannot wait until mclaren cuts this guy get my guy some ac did bro dirty lmao that mercedes has sidepods xd are those the old tyres why do they look so weird that thing is in the background i know what it is i also know that no one was asking my hand shot up faster than a fat kid asking for seconds its called flys eye dome and it was designed by buckminster fuller this is a recreation in the courtyard of the art museum i first saw it at art basel miami side pod merc side pod merc side pod merc damn there is no way its that hot there where at in miami what\\' s with the w13 the floor is different the previous side pods but on the other hand a new and much thinner rear wing here is hoping they dial back the sensationalism somewhat seems like some drivers and teams are pretty upset about last season and less footage is not going to help them they definitely could have made a more compelling ie true story out of last season i think one episode will be about the rivalry between latifi and walls i feel like best case scenario is they mend some bridges with a less sensationalised season 5 and season 6 goes back to what it once was otherwise it will just be red bull steiner christian horner zak brown geri horner danny ric and christian horner by the end guaranteed that miami gets its own episode hopefully the series reinvents itself because it desperatly needs to the quality has been on a decline since s1 steady at first with s2 then sharper with s3 and off a cliff with s4 season 4 was for sure the weakest but hopefully they f1 liberty fom take any criticism from fans and the teams to refine the format i just need toto to say pumpernickel once an episode i do not think its an unreasonable request i am pretty sure by the end of those 2 seasons no drivers will be willing to participate they have not been happy with their portrayal on the large this last season was so bad i hope they rethink how they are doing things i hope the attrocious reception of the latest season prompts them to dial down the fake drama and focus on the real stuff a bit more i cannot fathom how they managed to fuck up the last season the perfect material for a banger of a season was right there and instead they focused on mazepins early pitstop they also manged to anger some drivers which could have been easily avoided hell ask some of them about their best moments and tough battles and you might even start endearing yourself to them will buxton on twitter 2 more years of having to hear about people who hate the series so much that they will not watch they should expand the number of races episodes hope 5 6 are better than 4 that last one was a snorefest i am here for more haas episodes season v guenther strikes back hopefully they will take some of the criticisms on board and focus on storylines that are actually happening instead of just manipulating the footage and the interviews to tell whatever narrative they want to tell and while were wishing for far fetched things i want a date with gahyeon from dreamcatcher cannot wait to watch about heroic prince charles slaying the satan max next season here is to 2 more seasons that releases during the season opener rather than the season break where it would be more sensible to watch formula 1 gatekeepers in shambles it is pretty early to confirm and for the first time it comes with 2 seasons do we know what happened in the meeting between drivers and netflix i enjoyed the series but i am really really hoping that geri horner is boycotting s5 s6 i had to ff through so much country life footage last season no surprises but christ they need to step up the content quality oh no its getting worse each season i think that they should do a second netflix show that is more serious dts is a great hook but there is room for more content it would be really cool if they could do a deep dive and follow one time for a whole year by the 6th season all the drivers will not want to be featured so it is going to be all actors pretending to be the drivers with 100 made up storyline\\'s and another 2 seasons of manipulative pictures of f1 cannot wait to not watch here is to hoping they stop with the fabricated bullshit when they have enough content to produce a good series with the drama they already have and less susie wolff please it is drive to survive not manage to survive still do not understand why we need more fake drama in newer seasons if its mainly to attract new fans are they going to start the show from season 5 as someone who does not give a fuck about this show let me just do my old man moaning why the fuck am i getting a breaking news push notification on my formula one racing app to tell me some netflix show is coming back for another two seasons ugh another thread of copy and pasted comments in every netflix thread like an actual game of reddit bingo i have liked every season enough they do not owe me anything the show is what it is if you do not like the format then stop watching just realised if they continue down the route of overdramatisation they are probably going to use landos sarcastic comments in some stupid convoluted way should set the record straight on how the powers that be feel about the series lot of people were using vague reports to insinuate that the series was unpopular and done for dts has been an overwhelmingly positive thing for the sport and for the smaller teams and lesser known drivers in particular if you watch the episodes of a single topic from all seasons back to back the ones with gasly gunther haas cyril and ricciardo really stand out as amazing pieces of work i am really looking forward to the future seasons hope they make more time for williams alfa and the shenanigans at aston martin hope it documents the races a bit more and the way it sways from race to race rather than make up rivalries and force things on us do not mind the bts stuff if it actually includes more stuff about the car and ermmm the racing aspect season 4 was average given the season was crazy original res photo needs a box for cutting away from the on track action to look at some clueless celebrities in a teams garage i like these but sad no rain related space i do not like how many squares are based on final race results all the pre and midrace squares more interesting if someone has too many squares based on final results there is no point playing here is the link to the prediction competition sad no latifi crash at turn 16 my prediction from all the preweekend talk you could have \"fake water\" as the free space them showing the yacht party with the fake water on tv miami puns column 3 is looking good the pitlane chicane looks like its asking for trouble mediums are pretty decent most races vscs have been pretty common and i favour vettel as a driver over stroll also poor latifi and sainz they just cannot catch a break all the best welsh dragon that was informative huh i did not realize the adjustment guns were designed to only rotate a predetermined amount but it makes sense i wonder if they have a setting on them where they can add more if the gun jumps out of the head or if the guns are smart enough to not turn when there is not a load this is super interesting are there any other teams or maybe drivers on tiktok would love this kind of content on my feed aston has a very good social media presence for their behind the scenes stuff not a fan of the team but i am subscribed to their youtube channel for all of the videos they put out great share rspecializedtools i really do love the behind the scenes looks that tiktok has brought us it is stuff that even 5 years ago would have been invisible to the average viewer just because nobody thought to cover it i need a lot more content like this the irony of tiktok a platform filled with teenagers and kids being where f1 teams showcase this kind of technical stuff is really funny i always wonder what they meant by 1 and 2 etc for wings like is it cm mm or just whatever unit they use and can they go 05 maybe the changes do not look too drastic i am curious as to how that small angle affects the aero load on the fw gif will not open commenting to find it later i have never wanted tiktok before and now suddenly i discover i need it damn you aston martin and your super cool informative clip that was cool as fook but i am pretty sure during race pit stops andor indycar they use something akin to an allen wrench great video except that tic tok thing at the end cannot they just get max there to bend it a bit the first and last step are missing first ask permission from lawrence stroll and at the end have the correction approved by lawrence stroll this special tool a bit driver f1 you are cool but you are not building the iron man suit or performing magic lol we know what a bit driver is most of us even have one in the garage showing a 403 error to me anyone got a mirror link its crazy how much more hype he gets over someone like palou who won indy last year and is leading this year lot of work to do if he wants to reach f1 is he quick no doubt but hes also erratic and prone to unforced errors nashville 2021 long beach 2022 barber 2022 etc if he can consistently unlock his speed without mistakes hes got a chance but not many drivers can colton is great but hes got some real early 2018 verstappen vibes about him id say pato oward is a better candidate for a potential seat at mclaren but then again if its an american they are specifically looking for original res photo wonder why he is not in the car for a practice session this weekend o\\'ward is a better driver i am going to so much hype for someone who is still learning to keep his shit together when racing for big points herta is an awesome driver and talent do not get me wrong but hes still a bit far from being a nice suit for mclaren in the near future id love to see him in f1 but id also love for him to first get more consistent in indycar hes such a 2019 charles leclerc right now mega fast but error prone and hotheaded this mans rapid and needs to replace ricciardo once his contract runs down mclaren are disappointed with how ricciardo performed last season citing they do not pay him a large contract to be underperforming the team is firmly centred around lando norris a delighted zak brown exclaims he should get sl first to think about f1 plus without at least one season in f2 i do not see his potential f1 time as a success story stop trying to make colton herta happen it is not going to happen the grid is really young i do not think it will be anything easy to get anyone much less him a seat if his somehow turns out to be 45 i can think of 2 major companies that would throw money at his team move over heinekenthe las vegas f1 title sponsor is let us not rush a us driver into a seat due to the growth in the us flat brim helmet how to spot a dutch person 101 not wearing a helmet when cycling original res photo going out for a rip to scout the track better slam the stem do we really need to post every single tweet on the subreddit why is this something worthy of posting by bike this puzzles confuses and enrages the american yes and lewis has just woken up and took shit deleted not worth posting to be honest what does bame stand for this is always controversial on one hand yes there absolutely should be more of an emphasis inclusion of nonwhite youth but it never goes well when there is mandatory spots for someone who has something that is basically just cosmetic different about themself people will just say \"oh he is only here because he is \" is he sponsored by winchester edit nm his son is no it should not we should live in a socialist meritocratic society where the background of some people are not tied to its past and were black people and some other minorities are not always in the backfoot compared to white people in the west though asians do not count since they are on the same wealthy and educational level or higher than white people removed meanwhile the williams are trying to get rid of it lol engineers working day and night to reduce weight of that merc design team its free real estate because of the new nft thingy car going to be 0001 sec slower because that paint people do realise this is vinyl and not paint right original res photo funky i am loving the miami color schemes i hope the mclaren \"leaked\" special livery will be used a special livery oh god we are going to beef for p19 and p20 then that will look good in victory lane sunday for a team in as much strife as mercedes it does seem a bit of a meme they are adding paintstickers while others are removing it are the really that important for a works team i was hoping for neon wheel covers but all right for those not wanting to open up twitter norris posted a couple of pictures of his helmet for miami his helmet is a basketball mercedes has photoshopped his helmet to replace the basketball in an imagine of jordan dunking one of the replies was really good original res photo slam dunk do what you want with those words merc admin do be killing it lately its an upside down alligator i am just saying that 3rd drs zone looks really short it will be interesting to see if it is long enough to give some good overtakes so is there any team that favors this circuit long straight looks like redbull power train are the minisector lengths determined by the amount of time it takes to complete them honestly looks like it could be a cool layout via adam cooper some small tweaks from the fia to the miami drs zones even before the cars have run detection 1 is 7m later d2 is 3m earlier and d3 is 4m earlier meanwhile activation 1 is 37m earlier feels a bit weird having the first two drs detection and activation points on the same straight given the corners preceding them are the very sort where the trailing car will lose time just before t78 and just after t13 feels like it would work better from a racing perspective i swear the track is rotated differently on every map i see why is the corner in ms04 not a corner but the straight on ms09 have a corner 9 i always wondered how circuit length is determined exactly my guesses were centerline length or average of inner and outer white line length guess they use the centerline i will save this pic handy to know for when i am following the mini sectors on the timing app this circuit actually looks really cool id love to see elevation changes but some of the curves are a real classic design drs 12 could be huge for someone turn 10 is going to be flat out and i cannot understand why you would even call that a turn why does not the map have the pitlane you would think that an fia map would have something that important lol new circuit map link to official fia document edit for reference here is the old circuit map its nice that the drs detection points are all after a corner rather than before so you cannot play drs games on the brakes in the same way they did in jeddah for example as you will lose out on the longer flat out sections after the detection points so they are longer why now i am scared of too easy overtakes even more will be changed again if it does not help toto enough why is f1 making drs zones in to gimmicks two zones is fine but for some reason they are adding more and more to make artificial overtakes and drama speaks to the failure of these new regs rulemakers were saying drs could well be eliminated with the new ruleset no drs on the showcars for a reason right instead drs is more than ever before do not fall for the nonsense folks all for the spectacle i guess miami needs to be an overtake fest these drs zones especially between 911 and 1617 seem way too powerful i do feel the corner being so much more open visually on the inside with the wall moved back will encourage some to send it its a lot less intimidating the last 5 cars are quite musical e a a e doubt they lift still kind of like it honestly if i had not been reading about the renovations i doubt i would have even noticed anything was different aside from the bigass grandstands of course friendly reminders from 2021 of why changes are necessary i am drooling i doubt they will lift in a formula 1 car but still the new look to the radillion corner is very good its got the same fearsome character as it was before but with a stand looking down onto the corner those got to be the best grandstand seats ever right i suppose it is a little bit different lol it is the same kind of even the gt3s look fast af f1 needs some more static camera angles like this not those 400 too far zoomed in tracking shots i could watch that shit all day i remember the good old days find somoene that looks at you like toto looks at christianmax make sure guenther and kevin do not drink too much or stuff might get fook smashed everywhere are opening parties something that is done for every tracks first race weekend or is this just cuz its miami never knew this was a thing before a race weekend what you doing step fred seb looks slouchy lol i am actually surprised so many poster designs went with vaporwavesynthwave i was hoping more of the posters took an interest in art deco architecture cuban influences or even pastel beach scenes hell nobody even did a proper miami vice throwback lol the cliches just keep on coming was hoping for checo firing off an m16 and max doing a line off the front wing runixporn has better vaporwave art than this i definitely like the way they have gone with the poster synthwave i believe but still its really nice this one is nice haas still wins no questions asked everyone complaining about the same theme from all the teams but i am loving it keep them coming i wish teams did more oneoffs throughout the season than they already do especially with helmets some of them seem so bland for the season and only get creative in the oneoffs love the synthwave vibe does anyone know if you can buy these somewhere i am excited for the inevitable comparison video that shows how inaccurate the codies version is they have managed to create a track before it was built yet they still have not managed to completely rebuilt spa going to look so realistic with porposing keep landos head away from zhou this is kind of hilarious i like the basic design and lack of sponsors love the touch of his signature as the commissioner it must be weird going to hold this helmet expecting to feel the grippy leathery texture of a basketball and instead feeling the cold slick texture of bare carbon fibre love that he did something other than the neon pink and palm trees that everyone else is doing goofiest helmet design yet i love it this is so cool it is almost stupid props to mclaren as well for giving that much artistic freedom this is a really cool concept and design is there a reason for this though is lando a huge basketball fan or cross promotion with nba finally an original design if lando gets another podium and all the mechanics congratulate him by tapping on his helmet during parc ferme its essential a basketball game man is going to look like a gta character they should paint the t cam into mj\\'s palm so it will look like he is bouncing a basketball down the main straight its genuinely so awesome i hope he raffles it away like he did his monaco helmet wow that is good nice to see a big difference in helmet designs from normal like it used to be that is slightly insane damn it looks like real ball that is hideous i love it so much went from to it looks so real the halloween pumpkin helmet is totally happening irl soon right right edit missing word helmet love lando for this i can smell this helmet through the internet winner really that is awesome and will look great in the orange mclaren also many drivers got the pinkblue on their helmets so this one really standsout a lando superb design and a brilliant idea really cool this is sick i love when drivers do full concept special helmets like dany riccs football helmet design for austin a couple years back instead of just adjusting the color scheme with a few design tweaks this fits so well with the mclaren color scheme as well wow well done i am overwhelmed with different emotions i do not know if this is my favourite this weekend but it is the most memorable this is perfect especially with the heat up 20 in the series okay i am impressed with lando for going for that helmet design that is so awesome this is so smart i love it cooooool would definitely grab a miniature of this if one is ever made can i ask a silly question does this come out of the teams annual budget i think is the most creative helmet design that i have ever seen looks great best helmet this year aiyooo that is fucking awesome this is cool af love it that is one of the coolest helmets i have ever seen love it this is the best and funniest helmet design i think i have ever seen i am not normally one to comment on another mans helmet but that my friends is stellar i fuck with this it was a tad jarring at first but the more i looked at it the more i liked it really different and really cool baller insanity wow that is amazing really perfect pretty cool how the lines are reminiscent of his usual design one of the best helmet design right now for me i could not believe it at first it looked like they actually attached the leather of a basketball to the helmet wow this is legitimately one of the best helmet designs i have ever seen this makes me very uncomfortable i meanthis is sick i love his helmets this one is great just like the pizza helmet nailed it such a simple idea ratbge go heat might be my all time favorite design mclaren is lucky there is porpoising otherwise they would be penalized for traveling is not someone at mclaren a part owner of the phx suns or something like that there in the playoffs right now so maybe that is y he has a basketball helmet lmfao just wait til we see hes got a custom race suit too i hate this with ball my heart not sure if intentional but a cool touch i noticed is how the seams of the basketball design is similar to the blue lines of his regular helmet the rnba rformula1 crossover we all need hahahawtf what a bizarre idea and its freakishly well executed me\"lando norris will never be ballin\\'\" lando norris brooooooooooooooooo this is absolutely caked in cool ok that is legitimately the best racing helmet i have ever seen i kneel sick nah this is goated my god it is it is beautiful that could have very easily looked like shit but its so painstakingly accurate and detailed that i think it works i like it a lot much better than the boring 80s neon miami vice gta style ones this would not have made sense if the race is in seattle rtihi haha this is so much ratbge ratbge i do not know this is like ratbge material to me it just seems wrong you need a better picture for the first one i literally thought it was a basketball with visors tape to it i like it it is not like basketball is something exclusive from miami but at least is not another vaporwave design and it is not crowded with spam like the one from my man alonso good old ourlando florida would make a lot more sense for a race in indy but pretty cool wearing a basketball helmet outside of a football stadium is certainly a choice how many guys going to hit landos head like it was a ball that is a nice football ironically being held around the football stadium nowhere near the miami heat or basketballs of any kind kind of cool but kind of ugly lol does the world think of miami as a basketball town genuine question and kind of hilarious if so why though ratbge and he answered super bowl instead of nba finals clincher court side it disturbs me how realistic this is id hate going to touch it and it feeling smooth and hard not bumpy with some give we got to see danny ric\\'s but i think it is safe to say lando wins the helmet race it is so cool but it bothers me sooooooo much that the panels are wrong ball is life cannot say i am a fan of this one landos helmet max does not need one he just shaves his head bald and paints it to look like a football helmet checo one the other hand will put a helmet around his helmet because hes scared but max is not he does not fear anyone or anything for that matter helmut marko probably i like the idea but i do not like how it looks hes gone from tennis ball to basket ball this is unbelievably cool though goddamn this has to be the sickest helmet design i have seen in a long time ok this is actually one of my favourite helmet designs from him ever this is spot on this is so cool lmaoo i do not really like it but it is definitely very well done ratbge aweful taste but great execution i hope everyone on the grid calls him \"basketball head\" all weekend a la hey arnold hot damn that is a good lookin lid its revolting well done did not he answer superbowl over nba finals in the would you rather video that is originaland pure good thing we can still have this kind of design for once without 5000 sponsors desecrating the design philosophy or someone complaining about his trypophobia or something the ugliest helmet i have ever seen kind of hilarious though as an american i love that f1 drivers come to america just to fucking let loose and do all the goofy things wow very nice amazing basketball sucks 57 perfect score my god it is hideous ew lmao everything about this gp is cringeworthy ready to score a three pointer race it triggers my trypophobia i hate it i like it ratbge possibly the coolest and most original design i have seen will definitely stand out great job to the artistdesigner the least aerodynamic helmet on the grid should have saved the design for one of the mercedes or ferrari drivers can just imagine them bouncing up and down the straight lol i want to dribble it this looks amazing ratbge edit subbed in the wrong direction coming from the guy who does not know what city the lakers play for lmaoo fugly i hate it lando magic ummm no horrible epic and yet gasly met mj lame why is the lamest sport in america invading f1 this is stupidi said it ducks least fav of the weekend but concept is admittedly a little cool my eyes its at a football stadium what does it actually have the raised bumps it looks like it with the way the light is reflecting on some of those pics it looks like when you mess up the air bladder in the ball lol i am not sure if i absolute hate or absolutely love this it is definitely one or the other whole grid is going to have a special helmet at this point lol bro no fucking way lmao i can feel it with my eyes i doubt this is why lando went for this particular design but the nba playoffs are happening now and espnabc has a big chunk of the broadcast rights and they will be airing the race so it works as a crosspromotion for disney as well which i am sure they will mention and appreciate damn that is astrometric that texturing though that is fucking awesome the detail is incredible blursed that looks really cool i think looks like a real ball amazing someone needs to put this on tradingpaints immediately do you think he likes basketball this is truly awful and i love it le mau this is actually disgusting but its done so well lmao lewis and charles should be wearing it boing boing boing i had no clue they got helmets for specific grand prix i just thought they used the same one new meaning for bouncing on the track bruh noooo way should have put the miami heat logo on it let us go heat pretty sweet helmet but let the porpoising begin i read the first two words quickly as nandos the colour of the helmet does not help nor the texture i think maybe i should lay off the chicken for a while i love lando this helmet is awesome but the child in me is hoping danny ric takes a marker writes \\'end\\' next to the giant bell logo on the back kind of cool but kind of ugly lol whoever painted it did a phenomenal job the texture looks so realistic all that work and money for him to dnf interesting to not show the front lol my helmet has a sticker on it saying that i cannot paint it or add any stickers to it or it will no longer be effective how tf did they do this was it tested at all bruh all fun and games until instincts take over and ricciardo tries to dunk landos head he wins the best helmet ever award that is one of the coolest helmet design i have ever seen suns in 4 straight this is awesome move it basketball head this is my favourite helmet ever i like how they made it look bumby without it actually being bumby i wish it was bumpy though lerbonjanes you like what you see some people in the comments who do not think this is cool what is cool to you i do not understand how this relates to miami it is not really a basketball city the miami heat have had empty seats all throughout the playoffs that is fuckin rad that as the kids say is dope friking awesome move it football head no miami heat logo is there any backstory of why its a basketball themed head like a fuckin orange that is beautiful my favorite helmet i have seen so far what is that plastic thing on the back of the helmet for best helmet so far i love it so cool now this is next level cannot believe it is right in my backyard and cannot go drivers will do anything to get a signature from mj to be honest i would do the same heat culture baby i mean that is incredible this is just good moneysaving by mclaren recycle and reuse outfuckingstanding this is one of the most completely random helmet designs of all time and i am here for it it was designed by a guy called mdm designs you should check out their facebook he does quite a few drivers designs baller if it was a videogame helmet paintjob you could change this would be the annoying one developers give everyone for free as an incentive to buy better ones for money nba jaaaaaaam lando confirmed for the remakeif it ever happens lmao \"genuine leather\" let us go heat rtrypophobia wilsoooonnn basketball helmet at a football stadium cannot blame him though the heat actually win albon trying to explain bear grylls i want a whole video of people explaining shit to charles after seeing people explain smoothchunky peanut butter and bear gryllis to him i can almost guarantee it was lando with the boom mic crofty in the background blagging a free williams shirt this is one of the best videos i have seen f1 put out recently really enjoyed it 19 drivers miami is great i am enjoying the golfbasketballbaseballfootball max its all about the race yeah absolutely love this format it is informal but it does not feel forced to me the drivers seem chill spontaneous not easy with a camera in their face and knowing it will be shown to the world lol sidenote change my view or not based on looks charles is the most beautiful driver in the history of f1 my fav bits are drivers greeting their exbosses i know its such a small thing but still love to see it nonetheless sebfranz georgejost carloszak of course yuki talks about the food the man lives for it my pride hearing charles say in america you feel like anything is possible \\'murica one of the funniest videos f1 has done for a while max really is all about the racing russell looks like the most generic dude on the planet look up man in the dictionary and see the picture if you look closely lewis is actually trying to push against it and drown the w13 in the sea the cars fucked perspective makes it difficult for me to appreciate the rest of the poster i really like the paintbrush strokes in the sky though lewis with the initial d pose crockett and tubs just putting this out there mercedes produced shit posters in the past 4 races and their results were equally poor now there are news about car upgrades in miami and this poster actually looks decent mercedes 1 2 god souria really knocks it out of the park with these i am so glad to see she is getting recognition and work in the industry if anyone wants to see more of her work you can find her soudraws on twitter russell looks like the safety instructions card guy onboard much about any airline has some miami vice vibes nicely drawn poster the water looks exactly as it does in the marina looks like the car is up on an invisible front jack in no other team posters 2022 budget restrictions scream so loud to be honest it looks stuffy and kind of lame compared to the others hams face in this poster has that ah shit here we go again vibe i wonder who the artist is because that is really good this poster is brilliant just absoloutely amazing hopefully their car is as good as their poster ah a poster to match the car they produced so bad my brain hurts when i look at the rear right and front right and there is a palm tree on the sea oh wait it was not a sea right still nice looking poster feel like this is what alpha tauri wanted theirs to be lol i like the art style of it love the pre race posters the teams do they are trying everything is so bad with merc this year haas did it first and better could someone better in photoshop than me please add some dolphins jumping in the water edit maybe also take out that monster palm tree out in the ocean you can literally see how excited they are to drive the w13 from their faces russell has frank grimes energy the car actually looks like its bouncing i am impressed wow they totally got bottas looking wrong again george russell as the front figure of the poster what is going on here its definitely the right move to make from the fia to show that it is in support of the because to provide as much help as possible to get ukraine fully rebuilt after this horrific stuff is over original res photo fia statement removed ah finally something creative and sans blue purple bottas and zhou are wearing the same suits as james crockett and riccardo tubbs on the poster of the original miami vice tv show a refreshing design after seeing all the vaporwave bluepink posters and promos for the last few weeks alfa always delivers with these same as ferrari til miami has a flag glad to see the indian grand prix return i do not know its miami flag or indian flag these motherfuckers do not miss biiiig tintin vibes in this one zhou and bottas look so good in this art style miamindia alfa romeo always set a high bar for a poster and this is just amazing definitely got a tintin vibe about it with the art direction of the drivers this is a wholesome poster it makes me think that bottas zhou have bought a house and are about to settle down together alfa romeo posters one of the greatest really wish i could buy them it looks like we might have gotten a sneak peak at bottas helmet for the weekend too why does vb look like an adult caillou random indian flag is random edit i lived in south florida for nearly 2 decades and had no idea that miami had a flag or what it looked like fun fact miami\\'s flag is older than india\\'s flag 1933 and 1947 respectively alfa nailing the poster game again is the indian gp coming back looks like a tintin special closest well ever get to an indian grand prix now i guess damn this one is really great the better poster for miami gp i was wondering why there is an indian flag there then i saw the palm tree never knew that miami has its own flag bottas looks like tintin tintin i scrolled past thinking that is the indian flag that is a beautiful poster they win this round love the references to miami vice don bottas d at first i was thinking what the fuck does the indian flag have to do with miami alfa aesthetic is just always on point i do not understand the indian flag s what is the other flag looking almost like the indian national flag this just has a lovely vibe to it they put a drop shadow on grand prix but forgot it on miami tintin goes to miami really thought that was the indian flag for a second until i payed closer attention and looked up miami flag all i can see with bottas outfit is robin williams in the birdcage am i the only one who sees a tintin style going on with how much they want the track to be monaco its pretty ironic that their flag is basically just indias there you go the real kings of poster design shows the way once again enough of the miami vice inspired posters ugh the roaring 2020\\'s that is raw what is up with all the custom designed stuff for this race its it because the track is new outer is this going to happen every year thought this was last shadow puppets fan art for a moment tintin it looks like dale gribble as bottas got confused for a second thinking that was an incorrect representation of the indian flag google told me that is miami city flag reminds me of the movie the birdcage lol is that the couple from the birdcage is that bobby hill this reminds me of the poster with the weird butt why does not this sub put as much effort into art with all the other tracks lol lovin it though classiest of them all what have they done to bottas nice to see a poster styled from before the cocaine days people were hating on the alfa livery but it looks really good even when its not lined up my favorite for shure thought it was the indian flag for a quick second work by jalcalara they have done several alfa posters previously in this gorgeous ligne claire style wtf indian fags whata f love this style very tintinesque buddh international autodrome alfa romeo designers do not miss do they at least someone is graphic designer is sticking to the non crypto design scheme okay it is a comic in a country with a rich comic book history not an i the only one who thinks that the style is more francobelgian comic than american i get strong tintin vibes here but looks really nice such a beautiful poster i wish manor had managed to hold on they always did good work man those clothesi am in florida and this morning humidity at my house hit 90 and it is 95 degrees outside right now this is giving me some real tintin vibes i love it tintins adventure at the miami grand prix credit as a

subredditmessagecomposetorformula1 if you have any questions or concerns i do not think people really appreciate how difficult producing a live event for television is when the \"most important thing right now\" is constantly unclear in contrast to football or baseball or basketball where the ball is always the top priority no offense but this post kind of screams of \"i do not really know what i am talking about but i am going to tell people how to do it anyway\" i do not think \"f1 producer\" is a real job overarching job that involves the same people inrace and in this preevent and creating the graphics and for the intro event i am sure there were some time constraints in place that they had to adhere to obviously you are still free to have your opinion and some of your points are valid but i think there is a lot of confusion on what some of these people do and do not do the intro party was just that an introduction i am not sure why you expected teams to be interviewed or anything like that to be honest they really should have just put the teams out without having them make a statement which would have made the whole thing cleaner the only real issue i had with it was a clear lack of direction seemed like crofty had to steer the ship like an mc which was pretty weird for this kind of event race broadcast complaints are just silly honestly the races are live and the people broadcasting can only see so much from their angles they do not always know when there is an ontrack battle going on when a decision is made to cut to replay or change angles its generally too late to cut to something else i could not enjoy it because they kept rushing everyone in and out making it very obvious that they were under very strict time restraints my guess is the time restraints had to do with wanting a nighttime vibe without having a latenight noise permit like zak brown which was the only american on the stage sad otmar noises i think the replays of the start have become such a thing because recent history has shown the race is won or lost on the start hopefully as the racing on track gets better and cars can now follow more closely and even pass the broadcast will adapt to that and show less start replays you can also replace f1 producers with fans fans sometimes do not understand what the fans actually want and would benefit from the most not saying you are wrong but fans make the stupidest requests most of the time quite odd how you portray your own personal opinion as what the fans want you are not speaking for everyone else with these arguments so do not act like you are i am a fan too and i prefer the broadcast to stay like it is f1 should just let fans run everything i am sure it would be great what you did not enjoy looking at sainz blank stare instead of watching leclerc rejoining the track after norris last race not just the start replays what drives me through the wall is the need to show the crowds reacting to a drivers battle over the actual action on track i do not want to watch the crowds and miss the action i am not asking for much an opening ceremony or launch party for a race event is ridiculously over the top and why a lot of people were cringing when vegas was announced that is going to be so much worse a level of cheese on a grand scale i cannot wait for liberty to sell up when they have milked the sport for all it is worth completely agree about ridiculous start replays when there are still opening lap battles going on i can understand that midrace sometimes the most interesting moment is missed but it should still be done better as well i think that live timing with laps and sectors should be either free or very inexpensive data access is big for f1 fans who stick around finally more wide shots rather than tracking cars from very close which removes the sensation of speed its not a good look when amateur videos from smartphones provide better viewing than professional broadcast oh and same goes for filtered flybuzzing car engine sound understanding a fans perspective and adhering to it is one area the sport really needs to learn in order to grow the media that covers f1 is very entrenched in the sport they have been around for decades because of this often without realizing i think they carry the exclusivity and elitism the sports history is entrenched with f1 under its previous management viewed themselves as an elite rich prosperous group and marketed themselves to that select few as the world has become more digital there is a switch in where people go to get there sports coverage think barstool vs espn i think part of f1s hesitancy in embracing this change is they very much like to control the narrative i do not know the solution because for them as an entity there are extreme benefits to being able to control the narrative or the story you better get ready for 60 of the race to be fan crowd shots this weekend tv director has been shocking for a while i am going to most over in rindycar suggest penske has been eyeing up an endurance race since he bought ims could also just be a courtesy visit i would love it if f1 came back to indy i attended a few races back in the early 2000\\'s when they were there and would love to go back with my wife for a race she is only interested in f1 no other racing unfortunately is he penske material the scenes if the us gets a fourth race at indy the antiamerican squad going to have to be on suicide watch before the comments flood in f1 is not and has no reason to go to indy in 2020 penske said he was interested in f1 but that no serious talks were happening this was back when a fia official went to see the indianapolis motor speedway facilities i am going to assume the same situation remains neither penske nor f1 is interested i guess penske is bussy with indycar and there is not that much money for f1 in indiana i do not know i for one would hope indy comes back eventually why would not the head of the fia go see the head of indycar and the most famous circuit in the us original res photos photo photo 2 photo 3 cota indy and long beach would be the ideal 3 usa race calendar f1 indy 500 just for the lols penske has little to no interest in hosting f1 he could literally be talking about anything 4th us race in 2023 confirmed \"you like money\" \"fuck yeah\" so he only sometimes wears a thawb i went to the miami eprix years ago formula e and got grandstand seats between the track and my grandstand were a line of trees so i could briefly see the cars zip down the straight between the trees for maybe a quarter second i wound up leaving my more expensive seat and watching the race from the general admission area karun chandhock spun right in front of me and maybe 15 feet apart we shared awkward eye contact its the ability to instagram it is what you are paying for honestly 1000 is pretty cheap by miami gp standards considering cheapest grandstands were 800 so i am not surprised you are basically paying for the experience of being somewhere near an f1 car while getting a tan and drinking beer brazil living the dream 150 for 3 days 25 beer 2 beverages ya but when are you ever going to feel the sand between your toes at an f1 race you think they care hint miami was not chosen because of its die hard fans you are paying for social media clout not to see the race uh you would probably stand up for the actual race is not it hard to judge without a view that is actually from the seats like they care they are there for the sand booze and because they heard that is the place to be in miami this wknd lol if you tell them the race is between the safety and medical car they will believe it lol just like the thousands of people who travel to coachella just for vibes you bet your ass that the people who forked out 1000 for these beach chairs are not going to care much about the racing who cares most people there do not even know how f1 works its all about famous and rich people getting that instagram post with some champagne and networking from what i remember there is not a tv in this area the opposite side is surrounded by stands i think they will have to watch it on a tv in the hardrock club its not about seeing the cars its about being there and taking instagram stories if you sit at rascas or on your yacht in monaco you cannot see the cars very well either its about showing off hear the race live but watch it on tv from your beach chair still seems not bad these people probably are not there to see the cars anyway most of the people probably are not going there for the race anyway the most surprising part of this post to me is that those seats are only 1000 f1 could have had this race at the daytona or homesteadmiami road course god forbid people pay to actually watch a race and not just flex on the poors wait there is a race everything about consuming this race in person is a total shit show it leaves me concerned for the vegas gp am i the only one thinking there is not an actual safety barrier for the beach side did they not think of elevating it this is making the mistake of assuming the people who paid to be in this section are there for the race at this point i am just going to stop bitching and embrace the suck would not they be able to just stand up and be basically trackside i do not understand all the hate great planning lol in austria general admission tickets for the whole weekend are 110 and you can literally see half the track from there there is cars only in miami lol i imagine they will be up against the fence the people buying 1000 \"beach\" seats are not there to see the race the race is just the back drop to this particular social event for them its not a place to see the race but to be seen at the race how will they not be able to see the car if the track is right beside them cannot they just stand up during the actual race the prices for the race are ridiculous those are being seen not to actually see the race my first race 2000 bought ga seat was 40 feet from the cars at 200mph with perfect view oh yeah ticket was 30 ahh the good ole days cannot believe i just said that i have never felt the urge to go watch a gp live extreme cases like this aside will not you just get a better view of things at home its not about the money its about sending a message oh you think people whom book those seats are there to see the cars but those insta photos though why do people think anyone paying 1000 for hospitality tickets are going to watch the race on the track they will watch it on a tv at the bar if they watch it at all circuit de barcelona ga ticket 140 return flight hotel 380 5 night yes please i can sense some fyre festival vibes for those seats most people going to this event arnt there to see the cars imagine paying 1000 and see a wall but the people who pay 1000 for f1 probably do not even car for the f1 they will be in the vip area and drinking champagner and eating during the race anyway while i am sitting at the track 247 friday to sunday in spielberg with my 100 ticket to see f3 f2 and porsche and of course f1 this year it is over 100 for the first time let us hope that is real sand but you are missing the point everyone can see you i have been to 3 races and you can barely see any cars at any track having lived in miami for 4 years i can say this whole track and event is the epitome of miami flashy overpriced likely sub par quality welcome to miamithey do not care about the race its about showing off you paid for the seats i live in miami its the most fake city i have ever seen cannot wait to get back out games gone no that would have to be risen for 23 meters but for that the safetyfence is to low thank god cota is a proper race course there are multiple giant screens on track let us be clear the best way to view the actual gp is in front of your tv or your pc if you are using f1 tv account this is an experience you are next to f1 cars there is an electric mood beer food you name it its redicolus its a bad fake beach and it would be ears killer i am torn i want good racing because i will watching at home but all this fake lifestyle in the middle of a parking lot is making me sick and i do not want f1 returning and doing this all over again looks like a good spot to nap and have a beer is this next to the fake water that will complete the vibe all these people will be watching the race on a giant screen somewhere nearby the actual race is for ambiance deleted why would i want to seat on sand if there is no beach like sand is the bad thing about going to the beach which is what people who cannot afford a swimming pool do i thougt the yachts on fake water already did not make much sense but this is another level hardrock sucks this was a problem when singapore hosted there first race so much better off booking a high rise room for the weekend and watching from there miami gp taking inspiration from fyre i am sure things like this will get sorted for next year at least they are obviously a bit rushed this year this shit is turning into the new fyre festival its laughable if it is this fake i cannot imagine what vegas will be like how can you fuck up so badly lol yeah not many people attending the miami gp care about f1 that is ok the people buying those seats are not interested in the cars or racing anyway man as a new american f1 fan it really is a smack to the face i do not understand how f1 is expected to grow if they keep catering to a wealthier fanbase do i like more races coming to the us hell yeah do i like that two of them are now going to be in super tourist spots that the average joe will struggle to afford hell no does f1 as an organization want to grow or are they content with getting money from the rich deleted as an american i am already hating this gp there is a second floor in the beachclub if that cost more i do not know then again its not much to slag was at imola and they really do not do all they can either to ensure a good viewing experience f1 should really work with all the tracks a but over the next years to try improve it is the sand real at least cannot you just walk around and go watch somewhere else like at football games i always go to the fan zone party areas and watch from standing bar area nobody buying those seats cares what they are able to see only that they will be seen mrbeast new video place lmao the target customer are the celebs who barely give a fuck about the race anyway so it works out going to sell out either way most likely will not be able to see cars oh they will when carlos finds his way to the closest thing to gravel that this track has those seats are ment to be sold to influencers not real racing fans those seats are to be seen in not to see from something that caught my attention when esfand the twitch streamer went to cota was how many people did not come from racing rather they came for the experience cool people vibes drinks and watch cars too this is just an extension of attrack experience trying to attract that audience this is how influencer based marketing works see revolve fest coachella for example are we remotely surprised the race organizers only care how it looks on tv same with the people sitting there they just want to be seen there you are paying to share a space with beautiful rich people good deal i suppose if you want followers they have places like this in montreal too it is not a miami or us thing it is all and that is fine let those people enjoy that experience i will say being on track level and close is pretty cool too it is just a different way to experience the show is the sand even real that is why i always go in the back i know indy is considered low brow and all but for 1000 i am taking my father to indy 500 and sitting with a great view of the final turn and startfinish you could also toss in the hotel and rental car for fridaymonday and one of our fight tickets from minneapolis in that 100000 i really hope it rains lol bring on the chaos is not there a whole beech club they can probably watch from that deck i cannot wait for a rain to down pour on these seats are the races in europe this ridiculously expensive that track and its design around it is pure chaos cool spot but unless you are on a high pedestal you will will not be able to see shit looks like they will see plenty and moreso than that they look like what is on show for the grandstands when there is no action i those corners that would be so awkward to me to have thousands looking across at a few dozen in those beach chairs lol the f1 snobbery on here is something else if these seats are advertised as an up close and personal f1 experience and you cannot see shit then that is bullshit do not assume it is just women with fake breasts here for a holiday and an instagram photo i would pay a premium for beach seats where i could watch the race with a good site line if that is what these people were expecting then this is really shitty for them and you all should not be a bunch of cunts what am i missing why will not they be able to see over that wall this gp is a becoming a failure before it even starts i can see it now the youtube mini documentaries about the nightmare miami gp of 2022 fuuuuuck miami they are there to be seen not to see the race looks like they will be able to see just fine people there do not watch the race anyway they just want to be seen i would not worry about it the people that are going to spend tens of thousands for those stupid seats probably will not be able to tell you who michael schumacher or ayrton senna were either maybe they will remember nicky louder from that movie thor was in they will be looking at their phones all race anyway they will taste and see sand its crazy how they are in miami but those dumbasses could not get the race right next to the water meanwhile we have races in monaco so really was f1 just being cheap for mia lol would have been a cool opportunity to have cameras on the trackside barriers feeding to screens immediately behind crudely making an invisible wall i can go to midohio and see the indy race for like 60 the miami race has just lost the plot americans love overpriced sub par quality let them have it in peace better bring your own hyraulic ramp to see over the fence xd you can feel the speed duh bold of you to assume they care i get free tickets from some guy i know for the red bull ring every year he sponsors something or whatever no idea so many people are making out everybody who bought these tickets are there for social media likes people can be richer than average joe and still have just a big of interest in f1 as average joe it could be that they are taking their partners are are keeping all parties happy it could just be that they like the idea of this let people enjoy what they enjoy really cool i like it i feel like zhou ended up being the perfect 2 driver for alfa he has a very similar demeanor to bottas a bit quiet but seemingly a happy guy keeping his head down and just have great drives for his first season i keep putting money on him to get in the points siiick really starting to like zhou to be honest that is a nice helmet wow i love this danny ric vibes this is the one starting to really like this kid seems like he might have potential cool helmet too like it alot cool helmet good dude it has probably been said somewhere but why do all drivers have a special miami livery commercially interesting of course and it really looks like they were heavily influenced by a kind of blueprint of palm trees and happiness everybody get up its time to slam now my man included more basketball references than sponsor logos lol why does he have a busted knock off bugs bunny cartoon is it a logo in not familiar with that is one fucking sick lid man gaat damn that is really a slick design vibrant and really pops out at you aside from the playoffs being in full swing anyone know the deal with both lando and zhou having basketball features dope rip kobe what a great helmet design zhou hey can i put lola bunny on my helmet alfa we have lola bunny at home the lola bunny at home they all kind of look the same such a cool helmet and i am liking the basketball rabbit adding a nice cool touch soo good the colors pop so well and the sponsor logos are not overbearing a lisa frank binder with stickers f1 helmet edition does he sell them on scale can someone tell me how hes holding the helmet on the first pic is this guy a magician this is fucking sick sweet design he actually put his fursona on it the fucking mad lad guys i think he likes basketball love the space jam reference i like the \"totally not basketball bugs bunny from space jam due to international copyright law\" on the side nice touch how do i get a useable replica of this what does the chinese word mean on the basketball part very cool maybe a bit cluttered but its a lovely departure from the typical racing helmet designs all this miami stuff is going to severely damage my wallet with little dipshit and daddy gone haas seems like an entertaining and marketable team this is great news the idea is not ludicrous the company appears to have stability a 50 million or so marketing deal may bot be that outside their expansion plans and budgets 5his is definetly not a rich energy situation the kmag effect looking into their company sounds like a pretty solid sponsorship probably not going to be life changing for haas based on the size but who gives a fuck glad to see haas getting some new sponsorship haas going to the moon with a name like lunar i was so worried this was another crypto sponsorship thankfully its an actual bank that provides actual products and services i am sure this will work out so much positivity surrounding haas at the moment adding to that they have a very respectable package this year getting new sponsors on bord must have become a million times easier huh they had their logo on the car at previous weekends already why they announce it just now will it also be on f1tv with the announcement on sky i was hoping something in the us would pop up i will watch espn will broadcast live coverage of all qualifying and race sessions across their portfolio of channels including espn2 espn3 espnu and espnews very surprised espn is actually putting w series on their flagship stations my initial reaction was ok sure they will just throw it on espn and make people pay to stream it nice i have always wanted to be able to watch w series here i am in too good job some great broadcasting deals for the w series lately looks like more magisterial messi replays on bein great news excited to watch the only thing i see on the espn app right now is the spanish language broadcast hope they just have not gotten that squared away yet this is great news anyone from this group have a good shot at f1 fuck yes thank you anything to support these women yay i cannot for the life of me understand why f1 cannot seem to work it out for it to be on f1tv seems a bit of a nobrainer are there pictures of the cocaine chicane look at all the shadows on the road the surface does not look flat at all cannot wait to see ham bobblehead makes an appearance on the main straight curious as to why they have the last few starting boxes at an angle would not it be easier and more fair if these were straight or is there a required distance between the track edge and the grid box for crews to work ad such hold up i work for one of these companies and have not been offered hospitality tickets resignation incoming it seems so strange to associate autonation and gainbridge with f1 and not indycar aside from that i have been curious all year to see what michael schumachers cruise line is like this is probably the first time since the 70s or something that a grand prix has these many partners on the same track at the same time we got to bet on which barrier sponsors will latifi hit first space in sector 3 for reddit not too late so no zoom zoom zoom this weekend c i like this it means no part of the track looks similar so its easy to tell where the drivers are rear will snap into pirelli barriers if the promoters got their way it would be lewis hamilton is going through the heineken 00 corner presented by geico get the best insurance in the whole country glad to see mick sponsoring a part of the track there needs to be a carvana sponsorship boarding that is where latifi will crash carrying on for jimmie johnson i am surprised by an extent to which this community embraces sponsors you guys are genuinely excited about them and their ads i find it surprising because personally i despise every kind of advertising that is shoved down my throat and i actively block it from my consciousness like i do not acknowledge who the sponsor of given team or event is and you will not make me i am baffled by the fact that so many people have directly opposite point of view on this why do you care what about the space between gainbridge and aramco i am still not convinced gainbridge is a real company every track has a sponsor on every wall and corner but we have to complain this week because \"america bad\" huh ok fuck cryptocom i would rather see a wells fargo ad its like neoliberalism had a bender a threw up a f1 race track how is this shit content this is the most american thing i have ever seen in f1 these are the things that worry me about f1 in america everything is going to be sponsored was not expecting to see my former employer here will be a good way to see where the drivers are though why is there a nonalcoholic are we in saudi arabia or what gainbridge eh hmm so mow we get 17 unnecessary pop up adverts each lap is it me or do more indycar sponsors have placement here than cota how much more expensive is cota brand placement in comparison to miami cryptocom will drop billions on some cool shit for fun and mfs will still willingly use their service like you are being robbed by millennials right now lmao i cannot wait for this race my f1 team on f1 manager1996 after i start getting sponsors still do not understand why msc cruises have not tied up mick it is a natural fit surely this is detrimental to the sponsors themselves when there is a million different sponsors around the track they get drowned out individually ricciardo showed up at last year\\'s race dressed as a cowboy and did preshow donuts in a vintage chevrolet stock car later in the weekend cota hosted the world spameating championship how to get americans to care aye american here for the comments the posh stodgy european sport when your editor tells you to add in some british sounding adjectives just wanted to say very well written article for those who plan to read it nascar once tried to get a certain fanbase interested in their sport it worked but to the cost of all the die hard fans who felt betrayed on the sport that had left them that certain fanbase then left and nascar was without many of its die hard audience and without the audience it tried to get i worry that this is the way f1 is going now and in 10 or 20 years it will have been super popular and then drop off the radar well care for a minute not longer watch who knew all they had to do was increase ticket prices to 1200 plus dollars f1 needs to give some of us older american fans credit for having to explain what f1 was to people for so long anxiously awaits read out of stereotypes of an otherwise diverse socially and culturallyrich oecd nonauthoritatian nation of nearly 330m people by creating fake drama i do not understand why all these websites keep claiming that f1 \\'has cracked\\' the usa there is on average 1 million viewers per race for a country with over 300 million people this is not that much americans need a driver for the popularity to rise even further i understand why but its funny following a driver because you share the same nationality not his skills or character god i hope america does not start rubbing off on f1 but i fear it already has f1 was is and likely will be european centric sport just like indycar nascar nba and other us based series teams have factories there karting is better there as well despite liberty push for the us f1 still has more fans in europe despite gaining tracks in america 2 more in miami and las vegas neither european fans come to for example indy and say that change to look more european i really hate articles like this because it makes me fight the urge to defend myself with not all of us are like this commentary but reading those comments are often equally as exhausting i do think there is a disassociation between the average american consumer and what is being marketed to us we are extremely aware of how on the nose the strategies are to reach us as the target audience and at least for the people i know were all typically just as embarrassed by the lack of nuance what are we to do i am not going to not watch a race just because its got this ridiculous pandering but at the same time f1 will look at a successful event and go see all this stuff we did is what the americans wanted wwe style contrived title battles and results not worth it thought it was a decent analysis of the american marketing machine churning right now around the miami gp regardless of personal feelings re americanization of the sportmedia around it cannot wait for all races to be hosted in middle east and america did they put guns on the cars just like everything else they had to dumb it down for them to understand bless their hearts \"why do the la clippers trade for 2 billion the nba is a great sport but it does not have a global reach and the clippers do not have 20 world championships to its name so why are they worth four times mclaren\" zak brown he has a very good point benchmarking f1 teams against us sports team is just the first step they ought to compare themselves to premier league football teams one day if not being the benchmark themselves for other global sports i mean f1 races are exclusively international in its reach read world championship f1 pride itself as elite and glamorous so why sell themselves cheap the advanced tech involved and amount of employees each team employs are mindnumbingly high and they are highly skilled to boot the skys the limit as an east coast american the best part of f1 are the 9am sunday morning start times wake up get some breakfast watch the race and then it is over by lunch and have the whole day left i actually do not like races in america for that exact same reason that is truly an awesome helmet design alonso has really nailed the use of the blue and the pink so perfectly gorgeous why the fuck could not bwt let them have this pink on their livery looks waaaayy better than their bland shitty version of pink the car should have used this 2 tones of pink and blue damned corporate colors such a cool helemt and then there is all the bwt crap all over it i am starting to hate this company i like very cool helmet nailed it with the palm trees and the lifeguard stations it is miami you got to\\' have \\'them the most authentic touch however is that green circle on the back it is a reference to the very rare \"green flash\" phenomenon that you might be able to see from the deep keys when the sun can be seen setting into the ocean that is brilliant brilliant love it some other angles miami pink i like 1010 but where is kimoa best helmet of the weekend bwt is comedy the publicity must work for them however not that i noticed skipped over their water filtration for the upcoming home build probably because i am so tired of seeing their pink everywhere i cannot honestly believe i am saying this as i love miami vice colors so much but damn i am tired of seeing it already helmets posters everything shout out alpha for their poster though very cool design hot shit the blue and pink combination we wanted but did not get on alpine so this is where alpines v a p o r w a v e aesthetic is holy fuck now that is vaporwave alpine west coast times practice 1 56 1130a 1230p practice 2 56 230 330 practice 3 57 1000a 1100a qualifying 57 100p 200p sunday race 1230p not fully sure this qualifies as a repost or not i feel his version of the american is not really applicable for the miami region i was expecting this american danny ricciardo ricky bubby direct link to video here hq geoblocked so only works for people either inside the uk or outside using a vpn connected to a uk server everyone else will get a 403 mirror link below danny playfully throwing shade to valtteri i would support ricky riccardo speaking for the entire weekend with an american accent acting like its perfectly normal and nothing has changed and ignoring any questions about it what the fuck i have never seen geoblocked videos on twitter before g fucking g sky sports lol that accent is just as foreign to miami as his aussie accent years later and danny still qualifies behind valtteri absolutely love it a little known fact is that every aussie gets honorary american status if they want it i hope we get a focused trying to beat his teammate daniel this weekend the least funny driver on the grid most australians do not even see him as one of us anymore anyway they can have him honestly i do not i find it super annoying you mean the best photo of your life according to crofty opening party what else does a race weekend consist of that i have no idea i hate that i cut off seb in this pic he is always been my favorite i also got some good shots of lewis george and charles but i do not have an imgur account and i do not want to spam the sub with posts these guys fullon looking like the hottest new boys band the new kids on the grid look how happy they are love to see it 4 wdc in one picture get yourself a man that looks at you like zak does at lando everyone on that photo looks genuinely happy to be theregood call from f1 to race in miami gardens christian still loves seb were cameras allowed for nonjournalists or was it phonecams only enjoy the show and the race on sunday usa greets from an austrian f1 fan as on every race sunday my friends and i will watch from my place on sunday evening our timezone a whole episode about how lando hates daniel so much he would not even let him stand with the team at the opening party is coming big dad energy from christian and zaklook at the way zak looks at lando and christian looks at seb like the proudest dads out there poor kev at the back lol great pic hope you enjoyed the party the livestreams posted on f1s official youtube channel if anyones interested in checking it out why did they need rush the intros was the music talent on some crazy contract to perform precisely at a certain time kevin peeking from the bg mick seems to gravitate towards seb let us be real everyone was just there to see latifi the fact that you got a glimpse of the goat is the reason it is a great pic if they are all there already its kind of strange not doing the official media on the thursday nice pics what is up with ricciardos shirt does he wear one size bigger i was way too focused on it when watching the opening party last night landos polo fits him just fine it looks like carlos looks very relieved that the sand is outside the track this time kmag podium confirmed look at him scheming plotting dang latifi looks like he has a huge head in this shot i watched it on youtube and there were only a few fans relatively speaking probably less than 1k you can tell the production was trying to show as little of the crowd as possible zhou joining mcclaren confirmed s i scrolled thru you are post history that realistic batboy post is abnormal so what is the over under on the number of drivers who test positive for covid next week i posted a few more pics here is a link the beaming smiles what daniel so happy about pursuing hobbies original res photo well this is odd lol only bloomberg would think that ridiculously expensive entry prices are something worth celebrating the article is actually a very good read bb does quality journalism how did they do it netflix actually a really solid article really great article if you do not want to read it more highlights the differences between how bernie approached f1 vs how liberty approaches managing the sport netflix was a shot in the arm but if there was no f1tv or social media presence the sport really would not be as popular as it is now dts made it more approachable but libertys management has made it consumable love the dig on nascar lmao looking like a nintendo power cover from the 90s ferrari about to add caltrop compartments to their rear end that drawing does not show any difference between old and new airflow it only points out where the change happened am i missing smth smh man i just want carlos to finish the race as someone who is a total f1 noob and new to the sport it blows my mind that that little of a change can be the deciding performance factor of who potentially wins yes tighter fights is all we need hope mercedes solve their issues faster so that there will be a three way fight i hope mercedes upgrades work as well it would be awesome to see 3way battle between all 3 top teams always mildly amusing to me that they are doing over 300kmh whilst seated as if they are in a lounge chair original res photos photo photo 2 photo 3 i know it is been designed safely but man it looks fucking terrifying that the fuel is directly behind the driver like that this is actually a drawing of kimi you can easily tell by the lack of drink in the cockpit one of the best follows on f1 twitter have learned a lot from his posts ill be really disappointed if there is no cocks damn that seating position gives a whole different perspective this explains the bottass all the blood congregates in drivers\\' posteriors it really shows how tightly packed they are in there with all the seating and padding around them and also see the roll over area that the halo and the rollover hoop create what is the fia safety camera used for is there any footage available i mean yeah for safety obviously but in which circumstances for example the seat is lighter than i would have expected probably no padding either people do not realise the amount of core strength required to be sat in this position for 2 hours with the performance of those cars go try and sit in this position yourself for a small insight no pee bags and a driverno arrows point to a driver do not some teams have their drinking system in the nose forgot the steering wheel mercedes logging on to watch this explained again buchan sport strikes again in his running series about 2022 floor concepts i do not get why this post is so unpopular the video tries to explain a working theory which is does rather eloquently b sport is still hypothesizing but as a very fresh exf1 aerodynamicist his musings are a lot more informed and interesting to watch than most youtube channels regarding the technical side of f1 this year good theories this just looks like circuit specific upgrade we will know if they brought any upgrades to mitigate porpoising tomorrow when they have to detail the upgrades for the show and tell at mercedes they are convinced that they have found the keys to the lack of competitiveness of the w13 and are working hard to try to revive the fortunes of the world constructors champion team brackleys team was sure they had a car with extreme aerodynamics that should have given them a one second advantage per lap the facts have shown that this was not the case and on the contrary lewis hamilton and george russell found themselves as the third force with a silver arrow that pays a gap of six to seven tenths per lap from red bull and ferrari for the mercedes technicians the main difficulties derive from the exaggerated frequency of porpoising that brings the nefarious hopping almost all the way into the corners while on the ferrari it runs out much earlier as the top speeds drop while we wait to see what mike elliotts engineers have prepared for the fifth seasonal event there is a weight reduction of about 3 kg we have to observe the front wing of the w13 which was designed for the miami straights almost 2 kilometers long the image of giorgio piola taken in the paddock highlights how the adjustable flap has been redesigned to reduce drag in particular the incidence in the portion that goes from the nose to the support brackets has been reduced while the trailing edge it has been reshaped with clearly visible material removals that make the profile very shaped its around one tenth of a second if i am not mistaking right hopium incoming i said it yesterday but i hope mercedes can challenge at the front this season not because i want them to win another championship but because having three teams compete at the top is better than two if alpine and mclaren or any other team can also get to the top that would be awesome as well but it seems like mercedes is the closest as it stands 3kg equates to about a tenth a lap given the margins of the midfield group that is quite helpful for context a tenth would have seen george move up one in bahrain lewis into at least q2 and george up one again in saudi no change in australia but lewis would have been a fraction behind norris nothing would change in imola thanks to changing conditions and noncompleted laps in red flags obviously this can be negated by other teams losing weight but it will make a difference in isolation nevermind the porpoising hopium for myself 3 kg the whole team slaves away to shave off every last bit of weight meanwhile the guys on the front wing are like \\'our bad we thought we needed a sack of spuds in there\\' but they still have the porpoise which is going to hurt them alot this weekend they have taken the sandbags off boys its happening mercedes 12 incoming wings are actually the same its the adjusters on the end that are smaller haha sandbags 3kg weight reduction is insane considering front wing only weight about 10kg i do not quite believe this cuz some says mercedes was just 1kg over the 798kg minimum weight although they make this 3kg reduction they still need to adding 2kg somewhere else this may change the weight balance of whole car which may give a little bit advantage i guess cannot wait until this somehow makes the car worse finally can get ahead of gasly or can he let us hope they get knocked out in q1 again like in jeddah this is the same wing from aus seems to me that is a decent amount of weight to drop although if the porpoising situation is not improved by this then its not really going to change much new floor too at first i thought you meant they had unloaded aero which would actually probably help with porpoising taking 3kg off the very front end must do a ton to help with understeer but id be worried about even more oversteer out of the corners i was expecting to also see a very heavy zippo in this photo miami has so many slow bumpy corners the porpoising will cripple them this weekend what are they going to light up with a 3kg lighter a lap around this circuit seems fun i do not care what anyone says this track layout has a good mix of nearly everything you want in a track tricky apex turns 5816 straights long enough to pass on heavy braking zones at the end of the straights tight technical sections that may not be good for overtakes but punishes mistakes the only thing it lacks is elevation changes no porpoising this game is literally unplayable smh also that offcenter she will logo on the ferrari halo looks odd i know its because they cannot show alcohol advertising so they removed the logo on the other side but it would look better if they centered the she will logo love the turn complex under the overpass a little up a little down a little wiggle i bet we will see big time gaps there seems ripe for little errors i did not buy f1 2021 because i knew it would be the exact same game as the 2019 and 2020 version i hoped the 22 game would be a brand new game with new physics graphics game engine and hopefully new netcode for multiplayer but this looks like a freaking reshade of 2021 again ffs the circuit looks awesome seems quite long but very well done we have heard the mercedes and honda engines in the game time for ferrari not abusing the kerbs this is not charles is it me or does the marina have real water in the game its like a mix of sepang baku and singapore i mean it is charles it has to be hot right this circuit is perfect for the redbull i expect another 12 you mean dlc from f1 2017 for price of 80 euros got it garbage that area under the bridge looks so clunky and ripe for a big crash love the turn complex under the overpass a little up a little down a little wiggle i bet we will see big time gaps there seems ripe for little errors probably an extremely stupid question on my part but will they actually develop different car models for the vastly differing cars on this year\\'s field instead of just the same generic show car with mildly incorrect liveries each time how hard is it to get new engine sounds i do not understand there are so many engine sound mods on racedepartment for other games made by people and a whole game just keeps the same engine sounds for 23 years i fucking hate codemasters aw damn its just a repainted showcar this livery seems like it would look amazing on an at03 while teams are scraping liveries off alpha tauri is recycling that paint because you know environment oh an art car that would be so cool to see them use it for the race direct link to video here hq possibly a one off livery its going to be another nft by mr gasly brand new factory and windtunnel in 2024 audi will be very happy rather that than them taking over mclaren aston martinaudi stroll admits discussions news aston martinaudi stroll admits discussions lawrence stroll has confirmed that he has spoken with audi which is interested in taking over the f1 business and said he is very happy with the collaboration with mercedes fabiano polimeni 20 hours ago the presentation of financial results during the first quarter of the year coincided with the announcement of aston martins new ceo amedeo felisa replaces tobias moers and together with another former ferrari roberto fedeli head of the technical department since june will have to lead lawrence strolls brand towards the growth and development phase in the electrification era the conference call with investors however served not only to present the q1 results but also to comment on the rumors very solid of an aston martin approached by audi audi in formula 1 with its own team the scenario is that of the german brands entry into formula 1 from 2026 they are working on several solutions where the way in the case of porsche is better defined and looks at the collaboration with red bull the track that led to the acquisition of mclaren by audi seems to have cooled at the same time increased the odds on a possible purchase of the aston martin team along with rumors that also look in the direction of williams racing and others to sauber motorsport stroll confirms rumors lawrence stroll confirmed the discussions he had with audi in a brief statement in response to bank of america explained if we have been approached by audi yes are we very happy with our collaboration with mercedes yes the world of formula 1 is full of these stories the collaboration with mercedesamg is very close under the industrial profile and an audi entry in formula 1 from the aston martin door would be configured with its own team to take over structures and registration as well as benefits of the pact of concord aston stroll has launched an important investment plan called however to produce results that so far have been absolutely disappointing in the commitment of the team in formula 1 strolls declarations have been understated admitting discussions with audi and obviously supporting the technical collaboration with the power unit supplier mercedes could it be the bells of an attractive offer from audi to convince stroll to leave the scene in formula 1 in taking over and saving aston martin in 2020 formula 1 has been identified by the canadian businessman as a key showcase for building a recognized global brand and player in the luxury performance sector i remember a beyond the grid cannot remember who where they made the point that establishing a truly new team is a bastard none of the good folk want to work for you it could last three years and be a disaster rather than facilities 90 of the value of f1 teams is the people so i think audi will be better off paying through the nose for something like sauber sounds like the best option for audi aston martin is based in the uk and build a completely new facility would be great to see a seat open up again honestly the team was performing better under vjm micromanagement is killing this team i rather prefer the full take over omg vettels 5th wdc in an audi as long as it is not mclaren please at least have it be a full on takeover then i cannot stand daddy stroll much less when he might actually win \"have we been approached by audi yes are we very happy with our collaboration with mercedes yes the world of formula 1 is full of these stories\" this is what he actually said you guys want stroll gone so badly you believe every headline bye bye daddy stroll do not forget to take lance or let the door hit you on the way out this is great news the sooner the strolls are out of f1 the better for all this guy is looking for someone who can solve the teams technical problems with him constantly looking over their shoulders total micromanaging piece of shit that would be great we could see a full german team in mick seb or nico if they went full german in the marketing how does this work with the mercedes ties aston martin has how does this work commercially there is bound to be some overlap between their road car markets this would make way more sense than mclaren for one thing mclaren has complex ownership they have sold off or licensed out so many parts of the business that trying to buy all of that back to absorb the brand would be a massive headache given the amount of money being pumped into aston martin both as an f1 team and car manufacturer a lot of the world audi would need to do is already in place combined with a team that is historically pretty damn good at saving a few quid if my understanding is correct what that is doing is basically prevent car from going any lower then it should i think ted discussed this briefly in the notebook its interesting because largely speaking you are better off with packages of upgrades in 2022 because its more efficient use of resourcesunless its something like this which unlocks what the car is really meant to be doing and is actually a very small upgrade if you think of the 2005 mclaren a very small tweak unleashed the car i think where folk are getting confused is the idea that mercs problems are the latter if my understanding is correct what that is doing is basically prevent car from going any lower then it should finally merc can fix its porpoising this is why i love f1 and the precision engineering that comes with it it just looks like a few slots of carbon fiber but the change can either put you near the front or be lapped several times driver61 video that explains this when we first saw porpoising in preseason testing the trivial fixes people were commenting about included this one active suspension bumpersskates etc i believe there were even specific comments from either braun a team principal or aero sme iirc saying that those would not fix the issue it seems like we just had a definitive article like this saying it was actually the rear suspension so it just feels like this is ongoing clickbait to further leverage this topic to drive traffic so my idea of a zero height floor actually kind of was right and could work just not the whole floor obviously ferrari will bring this upgrade this race let us see if this may help last year i had a game with my family where everyone was given 2 drivers at random and points were awarded by track positions gainedlost at first it got very hectic but started getting interesting once everyone started getting engine penalties also it was a rollercoaster of emotions wishing for your favorite driver to start low on the grid to give you lots of possible points but at the same time wanting to have your favorite driver start high up in the grid because you want to see them in the podium would it be possible for you to share the sheets link i have been maintaining a google sheet of my own to classify the race results and the standings just for fun and i am pretty sure i have done a lot of unnecessary work to make it since i am not too good with sheetsexcel would love to take a look at yours that is pretty cool makes it a lot more fun thanks for sharing any chance you share the templates if we wanted to replicate fun fact more people were at the soccer stadium for ocon\\'s visit and there was not even a game on then at the marlins game where max and checo threw out the first pitch pink does suit him a lot so weird to see him so close to home higuain and ocon swap deal here we go poor esteban meeting some shit soccer players while gasly was having diner with jordan i mean i do not think an european have to go to us to visit a football team it like econ ring his manager and said everyone is meeting some celebs hook me up with someone as well lol i assume its a safety thing to slow the cars down before entry but its a shame that it will probably increase the pitstop delta and make a two stop strategy less attractive let me put a tenner on a latifi or mick dnf original res photo please not carlos please not carlos i am going to it looks too tight for your everyday road car much less an f1 car that has the slow speed turning ability of a 200ft long cargo ship i get it could just be the angle of the photo but it looks very tight coulthard is having flashbacks this pit entry with the possibility of a classic florida flash flood thunderstorms mid race someone could easily end their race there and if multiple people are pitting at once it can because proper carnage that reminds me of the le mans pit entry chicane in a way it will test the drivers no doubt to see who can master this tricky chicane we have seen crashes at or in pit entry before id be intrigued to see if we get that here since when is latifi called \"somebody\" no gravel trap so hamilton is safe everyone staring at latifi be like who will cut it the most i do not like these long time loss pitlanes since the speed limit reduction 2 stops have been so difficult so we end up with 1 stop and lots of tyre saving the drivers are lucky that it will be dry slow button on what happens if you cut the track in the pitlane penalty well it has tarmac when you miss the entry of the chicane so where is the problem just because were in america does not mean we suddenly have to stop putting turns on our racetracks latifi is going to make 1 fanbase extremely happy and another extremely upset then it seems cough latifi cough deleted china 2007 is without a doubt in my top 10 f1 moments of all time along with senna crashing prost out at suzuka in 1990 and all the bose headphones that died last year whenever toto did not get his way should be long enough for people to forget about daniel about yeah noice back up to a full 12 team grid aka the peroni ad with f1 car in it this is really bad i am going to the car is the least obvious thing on this this is feeling more of a peroni advert than an aston martin poster to me well it is certainly another poster from the aston martin aramco cognizant peroni f1 team p e r o n i it lacks finesse not enough refined gradation highlights subtle texture peroni bottle is too dull and looks faceted which it is not overly saturated magenta orb behind the car is slightly overpowering does not quite match her lip colour face looks straight out of shutterstock its basically a bit pony i am being harsh i am tired tough titty toenails the car looks strange particularly the sidepod bspec leak by peroni this sucks so who is drinking 0 alcohol beer does this mean vettel has a name ready for the car she reminds me of flo from progressive is that the same nastro azzurro that sponsor valentino rossi during his early years in motog gta vice city focus and have the girl\\'s face as most of the poster have the drink near her lips as if she is drinking it and have the car in the reflection of her glasses since she is zoomed in there will be more of the car and it will not look so stupid and transparent as a slap job marketing ad this is not a race poster this is a beer ad ah yes the real focus of this gp this is goodas a peroni poster bad f1 poster though will it be painted to look like the ocean ocon coming close to nando this week possibly ocon podium incoming allonsy a shame there is so much sponosor names flying around the man has good taste in helmets source quality of the picture is unfortunately not so good but its the only one i could find of the helmet that is what the alpine livery should have been i thought the gp was in miami maimi i cannot believe how crowded his helmet looks sponsors sponsors sponsors if the helmet was green id call it chick hicks i also dislike bwt demanding the drivers to pink it up i miss the distinct fernando look we have come to love love the helmet but are all the helmets this weekend about to look the same d gasly max and now alonso all look pretty similar going with the miami beach look that looks good miami vice colours and palm trees muy original i see they went with the vaporwave theme how original nothing beats maimi if only the alpine looked like this it seems as if everyone is bringing a new helmet design to miami i feel like i need to buy a hawaiian shirt or something just to watch the race great stuff op secondly do you expect any copyright issues going forward you should absolutely expect issues may arise especially if one of f1s broadcasters decides they want to do similar videos or features yep good stuff ta this is awesome ill definitely check out this channel after races you should add text describing what is happening in the race like max approaching backmarkers or leclerc slow pitstop cool job repost wait is that an american football player statue this event was so akward ngl looks like a wwe wrestlemania entrance stage they carry on doing events like this and generating the excitement i bet they will put the crown jewel label onto miami in no time bottas this feels a far too dramatic headline for what brown said in a podcast ricciardo has a contract through till the end of 2023 and they are just waiting until later this year to start negotiations and talks they have got time and hes got time all these rumours swirling because mclaren is testing oward and herta as mandated by f1 for the two rookie testing sessions seem a bit dramatic for the moment tomorrow norris extends hit contract till 28 always good to anticipate early people need to chill results in races they both have finished this year lando 15553 danny146618 he was destroyed in 2021 but is comfortably matching norris this year diffusor damage due to racing incident albeit his fault it was just close racing into a blind corner in the rain and not really indicative of poor performance mclaren in no hurry to sign ricciardo do not commit too early remy ramjiawan thursday 5 may 2022 0757 mclaren boss zak brown says daniel ricciardo is not sure of a place with the wokingbased team after 2023 the smiling australian had a volatile debut season at mclaren but is also in 2022 slower than teammate lando norris ricciardo was brought in for his experience in the top of the field in his time at red bull racing the australian was still able to pick up the occasional victory when max verstappen joined in 2016 he was sometimes able to outpace even the 2021 world champion nevertheless the overall trend surrounding ricciardos arrival at mclaren is currently disappointing the australian still has a contract until 2023 and therefore enough time to prove himself but there are also alternatives for the team from woking alternatives brown states in conversation with formula1com we have one more season together after this year and of course we are already thinking about the long term whether that will be with ricciardo or without the australian brown does not say he does hint however that there are plenty of alternatives ready we will test with pato oward and colton herta he says brown wants to postpone the decision on whether or not to extend the contract with ricciardo its best not to commit to these things too early and were not in a hurry he explains of the eighttime race winners tenure ricciardo feeling better apart from the contract brown sees ricciardo doing better at mclaren this year yes he definitely is his races are going better and he has won something in qualifying as well the 50yearold american says the man who took carlos sainzs spot at mclaren is also a year on hes not quite comfortable in the car yet but his bond with lando is more than good he has also got to know the team very well brown explains after last seasons dip in form brown is therefore pleased that ricciardo has found his way up the ladder of course we are happy that he is back on top himself he concludes why would they hurry there is plenty of time to negotiate indeed since hes signed until the end of the next season can you blame them if ricciardo continues to slump around in the lower midfield while lando challenges for podiums i would not be at all surprised if mclaren buy out his contract and go with a new driver for 2023 when its all said and done i think ricciardo while be viewed as a capable driver that made some bad career decisions and survived off his red bull reputation for a bit too long i have been around here for a few years and i have never seen such hate for danny its like he killed everyone is dogs really not sure where its coming from to be honest daniel is only 32hes got a lot left to give in formula one i am just amazed how far his performances have dipped i guess hes really sensitive to the car if its not working to his liking the results will be averagebelow average what he had at red bull and to a degree at renault is not translating over at mclaren i do not know what people are talking about to be honest he was absolutely off the pace on bahrain but obviously recovering from covid and lack of track action in saudi he qualified next to norris and with only a tenth between them and his race pace was great before his retirement in australia he qualified a few places down on lando but finished the race only half a second behind him in imola again only a few places down in qualifying on lando finished directly behind i am in the sprint then his race was fucked in turn 1 partially his fault but bottas hit him anyway which damaged his car and ruined any fightback but he kept going the rest of the race with a damaged car getting good data for the team hes a little short of norris atm same as carlos is a little short of leclerc perez a little short of max and hamilton a little short of russell but its not like last year where he clearly could not get a handle on the car its logical for mclaren to do that sadly daniel since 2021 has big decline of form losing to lando especially in qualies adaptation problems in 21 thanks to that mclaren was p4 not p3 and only had 23 flashes for person who was in top 5 2020 drivers it is unacceptable i do not see ricciardo staying after 2023 if he keeps struggling that much compared to norris but in f1 a lot can change in that timeframe i sure hope he will improve his race pace oh ricciardo i really hope you can prove the doubters wrong buddy yeah i listened to the podcast and this is clickbait if danny performs well this year and he has been on par with lando every race except the shunt at imola where he was right with lando he will get another deal but of course mclaren wants to see what their young drivers can do every team feels that way should hold on then grab a senior porsche seat to help them get a grip early feels like a good fit with his late braking and all unless something picks up with daniel i can see them getting oward or another one of the indy guys in good hes too much of a wildcard atm needs to pull off a miracle in these next few races before we can even begin thinking of a future for ricc at mclaren huge fan love to see him in his prime again i feel like ricciardo is absolutely no certainty to retain his seat atm his performance would need to lift substantially to justify an extension i would have thought i think danny was just really suited to red bull cars he was known for breaking at the very last second and for his ballsy overtakes i get the feeling that the mclaren is just a different type of car and he is not suited to driving it i bet if you could put him back in a rbr car he would be placing a lot better but the fact that he has a huge salary and is getting beat by lando are already two strikes zak mentions looking to the future we all know that means putting an american driver in the second seat unfortunately you do not look to the future with a guy his age in f1 anymore it is a young man\\'s game now i think he would just retire he has said many times that if he cannot win a wdc then what is the point he has more than enough money he will just land in la and have a bunch of sex i do not really see him doing anything else in f1 frankly the guy is as dumb as a bag of hammers but he looks good so he will be just fine i still do not get the renault move he made if not for the crazy money than what else would be the reason to go to a team whose engine just ruined your last shot at a wdc he is completely lost in that mclaren for sure but who could do better i do not think there is neither a better driver available nor an amazing rookie waiting for that seat maybe they could reach an agreement with alpine and sign piastri and maybe even use renault motors that could be benefitial for both as the mercedes pu is quite weak and alpine could use the data analysis of two more cars but i do not know smart from them id go for someone else surely welp pato o\\'ward should get his seat two mexicans in f1 would be so amazingly cool i love danny ric as much as the next one but his stay at mclaren has been underwhelming racking up this kind of salary to perform at a mediocre level most of the time below his teammate does not look great maybe mclaren value his prpower and technical insights more than we understand but performance wise its hard to justify keeping him for the salary he has deleted he does not belong in f1 anymore i would love to see him replaced by piastri if you win f3 f2 back to back you are good and deserve a shot ric had his shot now that i am used to the 18 inch rims these things look tiny lol i believe that is actually the renault 2020 car the rs20 ot i really liked slovenia when i went there where did you see this as a slovenian i feel its my duty to go see it in person where in slovenia excatly is this holy bargeboards the nose has alos 14 but towards the back of the car you see ocons 31 hmmmmm that is actually tadej pogacar is it just more or does that look very short that actually looks like a real car but it is 2020 not 2021 i think based on the barge boards and the vents right behind the halo which i do not think they had in 2021 fwiw its not last years car or any other years its a show car a fake car with a mix of parts in many cases they are things that were never even for another car and in some extreme cases red bull are known for this the car is a plastic she will i am so happy we got rid of barge boards fucking hideous they look so clunky and boxy now especially with all that greebling saward only wrote that de vries might be a good candidate for a latifi swap he did not write that they were in any contact sees latifi\\'s seat \"huh i wonder who that is for\" whether he ever gets a seat in f1 or not i hope sky hires the guy for more broadcasts he has the insight of a nico in his analysis and a somewhat similar impressive grasp of the english language but seems to connect way better with the grid when doing interviews de vries surprised by williams rumours wonder where they got that from kimberley hoefnagel thursday 28 april 2022 1456 last update 1505 gpfans spoke exclusively with the people involved for this article nyck de vries has not yet had any contact with the williams team about a possible switch to formula 1 he told gpfans the driver from sneek is not aware of the rumours and emphasises that he will continue to focus on his formula e campaign earlier this week there were rumours in the british media that the williams team would be interested in bringing nyck de vries in the british team would like to continue without nicholas latifi in 2023 and is therefore looking for his replacement according to sky sports the team has its sights set on alpine reserve driver oscar piastri however joe saward a renowned formula one journalist said that williams doubts that this is the right move the team would rather work on its own future by putting someone in that seat who is not linked to another team de vries was put forward as the best candidate de vries responds to rumours de vries himself however has no idea where this rumour came from these rumours are new to me the 27yearold told gpfans in an exclusive interview i have no idea where you read them the rumours ed or where you came across them but then i am very curious where they got that from the mercedes driver stressed because honestly i have no idea asked if de vries would consider a move to williams he replied of course formula 1 is a dream that is a dream for every young driver but otherwise i think it is still quite early in the season we are only at the sixth race in our championship so yes let us first make sure we get a few points here again said the dutchman translated with wwwdeeplcomtranslator free version de vries is one of those guys who went under radar because guys like mick get f1 seat thanks to their name and guys like mazepin got their seat by just money mazepin won same amount races as mick in f2 season but he had the 5th best team not prema tsunoda won 3 awards in f2 that season for a reason coming to singapore for the first time this year very excited what are the major tourist attractions that would be good to do during the daylate afternoon before the f1 sessions is there a lot of food options that will be open late at night after the f1 sessions what is the best transport from i do not know the area but from geylang road near \\'eminent frog porridge\\' to the track is it easiest to get from the airport to the city via rail and is google maps reliable for public transport sorry for all the questions haha nice to see a fellow sinkie f1 fan here my favourite place to go in sg is boon tong kee they have many locations but i cannot resist their steamed chicken and rice crispy bean curd also frog leg porridge at 4 am tastes good too finallysingapore fans how nice of you to do this thank you i am a singaporean myself haha and looking to attend this year gp after following f1 religiously since 2019 understand that the early bird tickets were sold out so looking to get one closer to the date having said that which areazoneticket will give me the most value and how many days would you suggest i should attend any other tips are appreciated where can i buy one of those half cooked egg makers where you just pour boiling water it nice work fellow sg lad is there any seb singapore merch being sold near the track i think i saw a few images of them sold in local shops as he is the lion of singapore i have been to singapore many many times and am looking forward to the gp this year as far as the gp goes what is the premier location to view the race from the track and what is the best post race venue any recommendations for areas to stay at i will be at the bay grandstand and a bit lost at the moment on where to stay lodgings wise i mean i got a ticket to the pit grandstand taking an extended vacation from work this year as i am working far too much and finishing it with the race splurging on accommodations and the tickets but i love street food fancy parties are not my thing any highlights for hawker centres near the track area i love walking through cities best way to get a feel for the place so if it is a few kilometres away that is all good additionally are the concerts an all day or night thing cannot wait to experience this thanks so much for doing this do you know in general where drivers come in to the track so we have the opportunity for a picture or autograph right now my wife and i have tickets for turn 1 which gets us access to all four zones i believe we are also staying for a week after the race anything you recommend we go do on weekdays where there are less crowds possibly thanks booked my flight just a few days ago coming from the us houston texas and have a few general questions in markets and food centres are transactions mostly cashless or do you always need to carry a good amount of cash what is the scene like around the circuit both before and after the events each evening packed bars and convenience shops difficult to get around etc does it take long to get inout of the track area like how much time should you budget for ticket scanning finding seats food and drink lines etc i have been told i must try chili crab as such any recommendations for chili crab locales we were hoping to go to the gp as we are vacationing in bali at that time but a 3 hour flight is just a bit too far for a one day trip we will be sure to plan it better next year have fun you all i depart in the morning to go to miami for my first grand prix have tickets in the turn 1 grandstands does anyone have any advice really excited for the gp most of the track looks like it should be fun from a racing standpoint and from a viewers standpoint i still hate the overly tacky couple of bits but depending on how the race is directed i hope i will not have to see the stupid marina and beach more than once i do not understand the rampant hate for this gp before its even happened once so many f1 fans are just obnoxiously stuck in the past all this hype around miami feels like f1 is trying to replace monaco does anyone know if redbull brought further upgrades to miami or are they running their imola update package this feels like the ultimate apples to oranges comparison where there is no correct answer but here goes what is the best part of any track to be a viewer at in other words if you could have a front row seat to any place on the f1 calendar where are you sitting is it where the track is is it how good the racing is at that specific part is it how good a look you get at the action us people going to montreal what is your strategy for getting tested before returning to the us our hotel is kind of boutiqueey so its not offering inhotel testing they sent me to this service biron that is expensive but does testing i am wondering if there is anything else i am missing thanks i am watching the classic usa 1982 f1 race in las vegas on sky f1 what a terrible looking track i did not realise it genuinely was in the car park of caesar\\'s palace looks like it was throw together in a few days i am genuinely beyond excited for the miami gp this is hyped up a lot by the videos and f1\\'s investment looks very exciting has any grand prix been hyped as much as miami this year singapore 2008 might be that one as it was the first ever night race in f1 but i do not think any other race matched the hype does anyone know of any f1 related things to see outside of the circuit itself i know that there is a red bull show car in front of one of the hotels and there is a williams pop up somewhere but other than that i am not sure of anything happening around the city austin was great for a few years when it came to f1 stuff to see around town i am in the uk where the f1 tv app does not work for live streaming without a vpn but does anyone know if you can watch recent races the day after or week after i know it offers historic races but i just want to know how recent of a race you can watch what happened to that show and tell thing they were introducing this year i assume i have just completely missed it but i thought it would be a bigger deal when i first heard about it iv only just got back into f1 but i feel skyf1 are very pushy in terms of getting in the drivers faces etc and they had an interview with christian on the pit wall mid race how do you add the f1teams to your reddit name how are race distances determined as far as i know they have to be at least 300km i have come to learn that the upcoming miami gp will be around 308km so why is it this and why not one lap less or one lap more thanks question for some of you grand prix veterans the miami grand prix will be the first for my friend and i we have seats at turn 18 and i could not be more excited to actually watch in person just wondering what is the best way to watch have the f1tv international broadcast playing in headphones for commentary is there much of a delay or will the screensproduction there be good enough to follow what is happening any other tips and tricks are super appreciated are ticket prices normally this high for an f1 race i was so excited when they announced the gp in miami and was planning on going it would be my first gp but prices are soo high i am discouraged to purchase a ticket at the current prices i am looking every 30 min for ticket price changes does anyone know a good place to purchase tickets or even have an extra one honestly any advice is appreciated thanks overunder on how many times we see brady and jordan on race day i am genuinely excited not just because it is in the states but i like seeing new tracks with that said was there ever any talk about holding it at night i mean i understand the issue with timing and having a race at 010300 in europe but racing under the lights at this track would be amazing anyone know of watch parties in nyc not usually my thing but miami seems like a good one to watch with a crew i want to learn more about the science behind the cars does anyone have good resources i am very knowledgeable about physics so i will take any references idc if its meant for a child or a phd i have an extra room at the eden roc for miami the hotels are now going for 1200 usd a night i paid 300 and would be willing to transfer to someone for the 300 a night rate best place to offer this up i am currently awaiting my requests to join some facebook groups for miami how was ferrari allowed to test a new floor during the pirelli tyre tests 40 of rain on sunday in miami why are you guys so hard to please anyone else surprised that nascar is having their darlington race at the same time as the miami gp i do not personally like nascar myself but i am wondering which series decided on that timeslot first and if the other decided to compete directly by design or if its just an unfortunate coincidence wondering what the fans of both series think of this i do love f1 for making one of the few races on the calendar that i could have a drink during since its not on at 8am happen on mothers day so i get to miss it on the road i do not watch much sports center and i am not in florida but disappointed in the lack of hype for this race in the general media seems like there was a lot of talk after texas last year not sure what i am expecting but it seems to be very quiet does anyone know anything about the relationship in the garage at alfa i feel like i have heard relatively little about the team despite decent performances from bottas and zhou just saw they are 4th in constructors i have heard rumours about a ricciardogasly swap does this rumour have any merit or is it just something to gain attention it is so annoying how hard they are pushing the gp sending george to a heat game leclerc checo and max to a marlins game pierre meeting jordan and lewis with tom brady no fernando at the miami opening not sure why f1 is going with the so bad its good approach for this race any idea has there ever been an f race where they just threw up a race track and no one really knew what was going to happen on it like this from my understanding miami has a lot of long straights and red bull has been the fastest on the straights therefore max is the favorite this weekend is this thinking correct anyone order miami merch from mclaren just curious if anyone has had their order ship yet i ordered on launch day and only got an order email nothing about shipping yet was hoping to get it before the race sunday what is the best site for buying gp tickets second hand ill be in houston during the usgp on oct 23 i found some tickets on seatgeek is that any good is miami open to general trackrace activities beyond f1 like cota or is this strictly an f1 venue when do you think the seasons first race without a safety car will be i feel like the drs will be overpowered here the one in the finish straigh line looks fine but the other 2 seems to long can someone explain the water meme that is been going around before the miami gp anyone going to baku recommendation on hotels hey guys i see you pop up on my frontpage from tiem to time so i think of you guys once in awhile well today a live streamer his name is jake was invited by the mclaren racing team so hes in the cars and in the pits any charlotte nc fans in here so what will be the fast lap time in practice will there be any safety cars in the race i say yes i need to get this off my chest other than cota the f1 season should not recur in the usa not las vegas or miami it feels like an money making machine now why would they give the usa out of all countries three races it is beginning to feel like a joke at this point i am actually looking forward to hearing some peoples opinion but this is driving me crazy the tracks they create now seem so familiar it is so annoying at least take drs out now if the cars can race closer and for the love of god design a track that is not walled off make it safer and more accessible to other sports adopt new tracks just do not create these long straights where that is the only way to overtake it is getting annoying at this point 22 races is too much drivers know they can afford to dnf out of 12 races and still win the championship make it less make every rave worth more okay i am done hes a shit person a bad driver and his countrys government is fucking up but nikitas 2022 helmet was nice as hell is there any elevation change around the miami track or is it all flat i am not super privy on how the point system has worked over the years but has a championship or maybe even a position in the standings been decided by a fastest lap if not is it possible with current system ok so we know that track time is limited in f1 cars the only times they can practice is during fp1 etc but what is dripping them from getting in an f2 car and taking it out to get a feel for the track does anyone know anything about the relationship in the garage at alfa i feel like i have heard relatively little about the team despite decent performances from bottas and zhou just saw they are 4th in constructors english version for the first time a formula 1 race weekend will take place in miami the route in the sunshine state is therefore completely unknown the drivers could only test it using the simulator the fans are all the more excited about the performance of the individual camps and which updates can be expected after the debacle in imola special focus is on mercedes and lewis hamilton for whom the new terrain in florida could also be an opportunity opponent red bull on the other hand is on top after the double victory in the autodromo enzo e dino ferrari world champion max verstappen won ahead of teammate sergio perez and at the same time caused disillusionment at the scuderia which could not live up to its expectations at the ferrari home game world championship leader charles leclerc finished sixth carlos sainz retired nevertheless the outcome of the coming race weekend not least because of the unfamiliar track is completely open said street circuit the miami international autodrome which runs around the hard rock stadium of the miami dolphins has many challenging corners and a 128 km long straight ready in which top speeds of up to 320 kmh can be reached three drs zones also provide a spectacle the pay tv station broadcasts the race i am just glad mazepin is not racing this track feel bad for latifi already though'"
